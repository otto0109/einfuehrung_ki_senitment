sound quality was the same between the two  but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .	1
i bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it .	1
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .	0
the setup and transfer process was cake for me .	1
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !	1
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .	0
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels  first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks  flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store  which  if you ever plan to pay for your music  is by far the best .	0
3 ) 4x zoom is nice	1
get it  it 's woth every penny ! !	1
it 's a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up .	1
the catch with the canon g3 camera  ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .	0
video output stopped workin .	0
there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote .	1
the software was great  as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .	1
creative are * the * sound people for computers  i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .	0
in addition  it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player  although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .	0
great feature list  poor reliability .	1
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .	0
only 1 problem  no accessories ... yet .	0
it will read and play all cd audio disc .	1
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections  and with no v-hold .	0
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective  and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .	1
i 've had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision .	1
i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !	1
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .	0
it still fits in the palm of your hand  and it 's not heavy .	1
but for what i do use it is perfect .	1
on the positive side  the sound of the player is pretty good  once you have everything configured .	1
7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .	0
the dynamic playlists ( " now playing "  i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .	0
first of all  i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .	0
it sends discoutinous signals to tv  so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .	0
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .	0
after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .	0
as it stands now  the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel  or if you load up all your songs beforehand .	0
maybe it is my lack of experience  but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .	0
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff  progressive scan feature .	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .	1
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .	0
the service from the supplier was exceptional .	1
amazon is awaesome !	1
well  it was nice while it lasted .	1
cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .	0
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd 's  dvd - / + r 's .	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .	0
all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .	0
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well	0
software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest  the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .	0
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .	0
for the price and features it is really good .	1
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice  similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .	1
nice machines  but i consider their quality pretty low now .	0
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .	1
the door would not close .	0
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of  and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can 't go wrong .	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times  not sensitive enough at others .	0
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .	0
so yes  as with all software bundled with creative products  it was useless and ugly .	0
it sounds decent  but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .	0
it practically plays almost everything you give it .	1
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .	1
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .	0
but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working .	0
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .	0
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority  aperature priority  light metering adjustments  etc.  but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .	1
it wo n't play all of my movies .	0
the first one would n't work from the start .	0
other plusses : changable battery  loads of presets for environments  decent construction  still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .	1
it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .	1
after we discovered the problems  we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months )  but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy  and they do not answer their web customer support .	0
it does n't have firewire  not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .	0
overall  a very disappointing product .	0
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light )  and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .	0
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen  and used  ever .	1
i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .	1
they look fantastic .	1
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price  although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs .	1
takes excellent photos .	1
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images .	1
what a disappointment !	0
compared to everything else in this category  this is most definately the best bang for the buck .	1
the other controls are all very easy to use .	1
the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling .	1
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .	0
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "	0
i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .	1
but  it seems to work so well now  that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .	0
working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! !	1
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .	1
the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .	0
it would either not play the song at all  or skip wildly  no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .	0
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback  while the counter on the player kept going .	0
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .	1
the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement  but the toggle switch is still tricky .	1
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .	0
it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing !	1
well flash photos are never great  and there was still a lot of noise .	0
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer  like some players	0
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .	0
i find this to be a great feature .	1
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's  or as " sexy " looking .	0
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .	1
but the earbuds suck !	0
like it 's predecessor  the quickly revised nx  this player boasts a decent size and weight  a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags  and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .	1
it would spin  read  spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .	0
because this camera is beautiful .	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .	1
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330  and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod .	1
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .	0
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .	1
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .	0
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .	1
on my main computer the software did not work right .	0
however  i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .	0
easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot .	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .	1
like other reviewers  installation was hell .	0
this dvd play is basicly junk .	0
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical	0
the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .	1
this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something  it will work when it did not work one time before .	0
1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )	0
i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating  and the interface with the player is sub-par .	0
i tried called apex cust service  no help .	0
each of the 4 lasted less than six months .	0
overall i 'm happy with my toy .	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred  you will become frustrated quite quickly .	0
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours  and then it died .	0
the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .	1
can 't say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .	0
seriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .	1
neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )	0
the price compared to the ipod is great .	1
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units .	0
despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .	1
i wo n't go into the details here  as the online sites ( stevesdigicams  dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers .	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage .	1
this is my second creative labs mp3 player  and it is definitely a fine product .	1
also  the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage .	1
it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod  and has a longer battery life .	0
for instance  i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .	1
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .	1
learning how to use it will not take very long .	1
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .	0
scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter  but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine  but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !	0
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .	0
to keep it short  this is cheaper  and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .	1
by the way  it looks nice also .	1
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .	1
i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed .	0
software - the software is crap .	0
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .	0
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .	1
we are overall pleased with product .	1
no line out jack - as i said  there is none .	0
you 're going to need to buy new headphones  the stock ones suck	0
excellent range of metering options as well .	1
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .	0
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .	1
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .	0
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash  you want something that has the asthetics bit down  of course	0
however  the creative software is not real intuitive .	0
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .	0
i had no problems following their installation instructions .	1
when we tried to hook up the first one  it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .	0
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .	0
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .	0
the prints are beautiful !	1
4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen )  a lot of features and add-on options  comes with great software ( not to be overlooked )  and last but by far not least  received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )	1
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .	1
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder  i highly recommend the camera .	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .	0
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .	1
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .	1
nothing but hassle with this company .	0
oh  and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "	0
-- > does not recognize player at random times  despite being connected and displaying player 's library .	0
the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .	0
loved the slim design .	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .	0
but  if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it !	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .	0
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .	1
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .	0
the environmental audio  however  is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )	0
and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?	1
- best in class sound	1
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .	0
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .	0
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .	0
i am quite happy with the camera .	1
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .	1
i must have differing preferences than others here  as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .	1
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .	0
imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .	0
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online  then you can do the same with the zen .	1
i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched !	1
however  for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice .	1
the dvd player does not work properly .	0
i will never buy a creative product again .	0
anyway  this player is a great deal and i really love it .	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod  but i have gotten use to them  and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .	0
the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .	0
lots of sound options  has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .	1
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .	1
this is by far the nicest one  in so many ways .	1
besides the one problem  this machine is amazing !	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .	1
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .	1
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .	1
i highly recommend it .	1
( batteries last longer too ! )	1
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .	0
have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com )  but the e-mail address is not valid .	0
many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .	0
much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player  some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on  but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate	1
i 've had it for a week now  do n't regret the purchase one bit  and i never leave home without it .	1
crappy headphones .	0
in fact  i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .	0
i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .	0
it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery  just like any other battery-powered appliance .	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds  and now the player can 't play everything .	0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .	1
quite simply  the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .	0
also  i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .	0
there are a lot of things i like about it .	1
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .	1
my " fast forward " button works  but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .	0
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .	1
it is great sounding  even with the supplied earbuds .	1
overall : small  sounds great  and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !	1
definetely a great camera .	1
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .	1
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .	1
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long  it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .	0
it sure does !	1
the battery is nice .	1
i tried to play the song three times  with no success .	0
it takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid .	1
but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .	0
bottom line ... great product  unbeatable price .	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .	1
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me .	0
well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it  it will be a breeze .	0
this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it !	1
only one disk played through to completion successfully .	0
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .	0
- large easy readable screen	1
3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .	0
i love it ! !	1
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !	1
- the software that came with it was tough to load .	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .	0
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area  the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .	0
also  the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .	0
they 're pretty comfortable  stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .	1
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .	0
i love this camera .	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon 's website .	1
so far the software for the pc works easily .	1
without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image !	1
will never purchase apex again .	0
first  the sound quality is okay  but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .	0
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away  with easy to use and understand features  software that is simple to understand and use  and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .	1
the software is very easy to use  and within 30 minutes of opening my box  i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .	1
also  very light and portable .	1
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .	1
* software is absolutely terrible :	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.	0
as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .	1
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .	1
the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls  especially the scroll wheel .	0
this is extemely lame .	0
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .	1
the remote is a little hard to understand .	0
controls are a bit awkward .	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :	1
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .	1
the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .	0
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display	0
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .	0
* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .	0
great feature list  poor reliability .	0
and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck !	0
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .	1
apex sucks !	0
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .	0
so far  we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .	1
i love the eos based controls and easy menus .	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .	1
the case is strong and stylish  but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .	0
feels solid in hand .	1
i forgot  the case does n't fit .	0
very sleek  stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .	1
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .	0
it would only transfer 30 or so songs  and then come up with an error .	0
this thing is trash .	0
the player feels very delicate  as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .	0
unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon "  my dvd player came in perfect working condition .	1
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .	0
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .	0
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .	1
the included earbuds were uncomfortable .	0
they play just about everything  but  2 and  3 died very shortly after getting them .	0
it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .	1
of course  i was hesitant given the price  but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .	1
this product is too fragile for normal use .	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .	0
the scroll wheel  to be blunt  sucks .	0
fm receiver - it has none .	0
we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28  the frames started to freeze for no reason .	0
this product sucks  the customer service from apex sucks .	0
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !	1
who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will .	0
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .	1
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .	1
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .	0
the powershot g3 is a great camera .	1
the player kept displaying " no disc "  so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @  * !	0
also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .	1
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically )  and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .	0
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment  for myself and for my parents  for whom it was a gift .	0
the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes .	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .	1
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .	0
one good thing  it is 40 gb of disk space ( well  it is 38 gb in reality ) .	1
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !	1
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind .	1
one bad thing though  i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .	0
apex does n't answer the phone .	0
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all .	0
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once  but it has n't done it since .	0
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .	0
it works great .	1
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .	1
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad  it has to be done from the computer .	0
it 's not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .	1
the storage capacity is great .	1
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .	1
after hooking the thing up  i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .	0
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "	0
way less expensive than the ipod .	1
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .	0
the sound is excellent  the battery life is excellent  the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent  and finally the price  $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod  is excellent .	1
unfortunately  this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .	0
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones  or external receivers ( car radio ).	0
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff )  the unit looks cool  screen is bright and easy to read  and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price  but everyone knows that ) .	1
the more i work with it  the more i love it !	1
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .	1
the grain was terrible .	0
2 ) storage capacity	1
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .	0
even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours  it 's actually a little less but still good .	1
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .	0
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod  archos  dell  samsung ) .	1
in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great !	1
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !	1
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .	0
1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !	1
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision  non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .	1
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .	1
this was an awesome player  before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .	0
also  the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .	1
finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .	1
software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better  but costs money )	1
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .	0
i just bought this player today and i already love it .	1
either way  can 't go wrong with this price .	1
the sound from the player is ok .	1
also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).	0
all the buttons  neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .	1
the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line  but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .	0
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .	1
this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .	1
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .	0
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .	0
not plug  play  relies on id3  no fm or recording	0
i liked this one enough to buy another .	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems .	1
despite the things that i have listed so far  i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work  to the gym  in the car  etc. .	1
i 've had this thing for less than a month  treated it quite well  never dropped it  and the headphone jack is all screwed up .	0
overall it is the best camera on the market .	1
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy  and has an awkward  tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system )  and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .	1
i tried calling the support number for a week  several times a day  and always got a busy signal .	0
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge  it does not charge by usb cable  this is not tragic  but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .	1
it feels slow to focus  and unbearably slow to shoot .	0
unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .	0
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .	0
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .	1
the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .	0
just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera  its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .	0
update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type .	0
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it  there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .	1
you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre  no other division .	0
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !	1
the screen may be a little smaller  but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .	0
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it  and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .	0
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
it seems to be working fine  but we 've not used it all that much .	1
the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .	1
5 . the zen does not have a stop button !	0
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .	1
other than that this thing is great ...	1
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .	1
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .	1
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .	1
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera  but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .	1
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .	1
bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .	1
nice palm sized unit  somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try  jog with it or something .	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right .	1
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger  now-blue backlit screen  which is infinitely better .	1
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it  and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .	1
it is made of plastic .	0
software definitely sucks  hangs up my notebook about half the time  but i do n't mind buying notmad .	0
very comfortable camera  easy to use  and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .	1
it plays alternate video formats ( vcds  svcds  cvds ) very well .	1
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .	1
i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone .	0
overall i like it .	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .	1
now i know why - they are pieces of junk .	0
with the automatic settings  i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .	1
it is slightly larger than an ipod  no doubt about it .	0
headphones suck  i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .	0
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .	1
the software is somewhat nice to look at  using it is not the easiest .	0
having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .	1
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs  using a multitude of connection methods  and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .	0
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap  replace them .	0
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .	0
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .	1
simply  the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .	1
have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo )  but can 't get through .	0
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .	0
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .	0
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .	0
remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons .	0
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .	1
this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it .	1
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .	0
in a word  " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying .	0
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system  and the traveling case it comes with .	0
it is some protection for the unit  but for useability  forget it .	0
wo n't play a lot of discs .	0
i am really impressed by this dvd player .	1
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .	0
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet  but being without a remote is hard .	0
in fact  it caused my system to hang more times than not  so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .	0
but canon never fails to amaze .	1
i purchased a jukebox  it got fried while being recharged  they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .	0
also  it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .	1
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .	0
for the price it is a well spent investment !	1
i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .	1
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .	0
finally  making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually  and are organized by cd  which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .	0
the dvd player is fine .	1
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .	1
some movies it played yesterday  it wo n't play today .	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e.  mp3s ) .	1
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .	0
so easy to set up  had some problems with my archos .	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .	0
no matter the format .	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward  but i can deal with that .	0
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !	0
3 ) user replaceable battery	1
well  within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca  optic ) .	0
i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .	1
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .	1
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .	0
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .	1
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .	0
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )	1
i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's  after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .	0
works great !	1
so  i 've had it for a month  and the headphone jack went out .	0
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .	0
1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod  and it weighs a little bit more .	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .	1
the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .	1
manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding .	1
have had problems since the first day	0
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .	1
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter  it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing  etc ) so i am very pleased .	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night  but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .	1
this thing plays everything i feed it .	1
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .	1
it wo n't play 80 % of my movies  which are all store boughten .	0
the picture is perfect  although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .	1
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .	1
i love the quality of the pictures .	1
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !	0
i 've only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy .	1
great colors  pictures and white balance .	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .	0
also  the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display  so even though the side controls are reachable  i have to open it up to see the display .	0
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic  a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .	0
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .	0
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software )  playback quality and value for the price .	1
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .	0
compared to musicmatch  the software has a better filing system and easier to use .	1
the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .	0
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through )  it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .	0
now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .	1
the sound is excellent  but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .	0
all-in-all  i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .	1
d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate  crashes frequently  screwed my music library up  doesnt work with mp4s  the list goes on and on	0
it also has unproven battery life .	0
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago  and so far it has been excellent .	1
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking  it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap  and it is a bit slow between shots .	0
3 ) with mediasource being so easy  i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .	0
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality  i experienced a flaw using eax .	0
it would just spin up and stop  and display " no disc " .	0
this thing seriously is a good player though .	1
however  it has failed to deliver on quality .	0
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .	0
this is a great camera for you !	1
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells  " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "	0
i loved it until it broke  but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .	0
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive !	1
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because  as other reviewers have pointed out  the construction is pretty flimsy .	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .	1
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .	0
weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so  it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x  3x  4x  1/2x  etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .	0
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .	0
the software sucks .	0
four megapixels is great .	1
if you do n't have tags  it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .	0
the nomad is not ugly  it is not that big  it comfortably fits in my pocket  or heavy  and the controls are not hard to get used to .	1
for some this might be a problem  but for the price of a 30 gig ipod  you can get a 60gb nomad  the ipod simply pales in comparison .	1
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile .	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that  despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service  the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .	0
2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre  artist  album  etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .	0
i am very pleased with it so far .	1
2 ) the body construction - buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic .	0
unlike my 3 other mp3 players  this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .	0
the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .	0
sure  it 's a little bigger than the ipod  but not by much .	0
because of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .	0
their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor .	0
my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty  but the case isnt that great .	0
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .	0
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .	0
the moveable lcd screen is great .	1
i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .	1
after using it for just a month  i could not play any dvd .	0
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .	1
door broke after a month .	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .	0
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on  the device still feels pretty solid .	0
the camera was a marvel .	1
although canon 's batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want ' more power '  you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .	1
the g3 looks like a work of art !	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .	1
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .	1
first  the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .	0
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .	1
but when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture .	0
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags  that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .	0
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly  but there 's no difference in working with the files .	1
the image quality is excellent .	1
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set .	1
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .	1
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .	1
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .	1
but the major problem i had was with the software .	0
( on here of course ) also  a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !	0
even after reading some of the instructions  it 's still hard to figure out .	0
audio is excellent .	1
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks  spills my beer  but does n't wash my car .	1
silverish color really adds a special touch .	1
it 's a very intuitive program .	1
granted  i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas  but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .	0
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture  zoom etc .	1
price  along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .	1
the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .	0
best electronic i 've bought since i was born .	1
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .	1
i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .	1
it looks really sleek and stylish  and does everything it claims .	1
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well  something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select  you have to push straight in or it sticks .	0
i love the storage in this thing .	1
2 ) scroll button / switch	0
both are very easy to learn  use  and intuitive enough for even a novice .	1
the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good .	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .	1
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .	1
overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view .	1
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?	0
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .	1
1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip  catalog  burn music if you are starting from scratch  but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds  3400 tracks  12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?	0
size - bigger than the ipod	0
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player  get the nomad .	1
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .	1
simple to use and hook up .	1
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose )  and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .	1
however  it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .	0
after i had it a couple weeks  it got into a state where it could never find the device  no matter how often i rebooted my pc  reset the device  reloaded drivers  etc  etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .	0
but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it !	1
* lens visible in optical viewfinder .	0
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .	1
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .	1
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots .	0
battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k. reeves .	1
navigation could be better  but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .	0
this is ridiculous .	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .	1
good looks	1
the sound is excellent  but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .	1
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu  and it still would n't work !	0
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !	1
it plays everything  even vcd 's .	1
i really have no complaints over this unit .	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .	0
2 ) the remote works  but then it does not work  and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .	0
2 . the scroll button is n't the best  as it sometimes can be hard to select .	0
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology 	1
the entire unit was poorly crafted .	0
while light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth  fast  but it is also eye candy .	1
1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )	0
it 's low profile  space saving design looks nice .	1
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .	1
so now it still plays everything  you just can 't see it !	0
seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .	1
you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy .	1
basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .	1
i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .	1
one still works fine  the other quit after one day .	0
with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots .	1
very bad quality .	0
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .	1
the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .	1
when it came down to it  the price on this player is hard to beat .	1
they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .	0
for the most part this is a good dvd player .	1
while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .	1
the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement  but the toggle switch is still tricky .	0
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .	0
a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .	0
ripping  transferring tunes is basic  and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .	1
the player usually plays dvd 's  but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .	0
i can only hear the sound but no picture !	0
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .	0
first  the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .	0
on the subject of headphones  this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box  but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough .	0
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .	1
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .	0
on the subject of headphones  this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box  but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !	1
* main dial is not backlit .	0
the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh  not a big deal .	0
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .	1
c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said	0
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .	1
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .	1
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .	0
the first one we installed did n't work  and our kids were devastated to say the least .	0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be  at best  a 40gb portable hard drive  albeit one on which i can 't create folders  or  at worst  a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .	0
in other words  the zen is not a convenient data storage device  only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .	0
good quality video .	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front  which i like  because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !	1
seemed like a good deal  but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes  " no disc " .	0
no way to contact their customer service .	0
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap  is uncomfortable to use .	0
for example  i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it .	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !	0
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .	1
i still have over 19gb left  and already have over 200 cd 's on it .	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features .	1
also  the instruction manual is very bad .	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).	0
on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .	0
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !	1
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .	1
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .	1
the build quality feels solid  it does n't shake or whine while playing discs  and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .	1
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players .	1
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .	1
transfering is easy  the software makes everythig pretty easy .	1
one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .	0
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .	1
got way too many blurry pictures .	0
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .	1
the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .	0
finally  amazon 's free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .	1
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .	0
the menus are very easy to navigate .	1
i 've had no problems with the software .	1
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .	1
retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .	1
as a portable player  it should feel a bit more durable .	0
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price	1
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums  this will cause you inordinate frustration ).	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .	0
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .	0
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time  otherwise i would get a no disc screen .	0
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .	1
proven canon built quality and lens .	1
it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why .	0
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .	1
this thing is great  i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .	1
creative labs customer support website is useless .	0
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit  but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory  as should be expected from creative labs .	1
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .	0
apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone .	0
everything else about the camera is great .	1
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .	0
the software  which comes with player is not good at all .	0
a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie )  but otherwise fine .	0
but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there .	1
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player  but not the folder name .	0
i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .	1
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !	1
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .	0
to my amazement  even that process was error-prone .	0
still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !	1
the headphones are n't the best  but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .	0
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists  phone numbers  address books  ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house  that one didn " t work either !	0
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !	0
this player seems to work fine with everything else .	1
canon 's g3 does it consistently .	0
only used for 3 month before it 's down !	0
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking  by artist  song title  genre  etc.	1
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .	1
1 ) price / gb of storage	1
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .	0
up  down  left  and right would have given me better control .	0
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .	0
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330  but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :	1
- included creative software is pretty poor .	0
it looks great - and is loaded with features .	1
longer battery life  greater accessibility to online music services  and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .	1
it 's kinda heavy  kinda like having a walkman .	0
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .	0
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd  vcd  dvd-r  audio cd and it played all	1
night mode is clear as day .	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything  just open up explorer again .	0
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .	0
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .	1
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .	1
had there been strange noises  or obvious defects  i would have accepted a replacement  but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .	0
in the hands of someone who does n't  it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .	1
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .	0
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .	0
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )	1
overall i like the unit .	1
purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .	0
not perfect ( yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances )  not the cheapest 4.0 mp  but the best 4.0 mp .	1
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .	0
not perfect ( yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances )  not the cheapest 4.0 mp  but the best 4.0 mp .	0
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly  leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .	0
bookmarks for example  are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .	0
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light  and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .	1
that 's a rare and valuable feature .	1
the software is great .	1
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )	0
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .	1
well  this apex dvd player turned out great !	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality .	0
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance !	1
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .	1
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .	0
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .	0
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder  however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .	0
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box .	1
whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together .	1
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .	1
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems  the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .	0
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen  and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .	0
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .	0
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash  where it belongs .	0
the interface used could be better designed .	0
the navigation is nice enough  but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks  hundreds of albums or artists  or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .	0
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .	1
* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .	0
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .	0
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects )  aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .	1
in any case  navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .	0
3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .	0
i love my new nomad  its great !	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !	1
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .	1
sure it had all the features  but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .	0
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop  shutter speed and even focus .	1
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .	0
otherwise  this player is awesome !	1
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all .	0
for the money apex machines have good features .	1
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg  kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !	1
even with these shortcomings  i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .	1
and the case  how did this ever make it out of quality control .	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .	0
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance  also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .	1
otherwise  it is difficult to figure out and awkward .	0
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .	1
and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..	0
it is a very amazing product .	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .	1
it is a bit cumbersome  and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .	0
p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?	0
i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it  it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio  but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .	0
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..	1
great quality picture and features .	1
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .	0
( i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .	0
difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult  " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .	0
minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player  the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .	0
b ) the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .	1
the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away )  canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon  that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .	0
i have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .	1
the face-plate  which pops out for the battery  pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .	0
noiseless  lightweight and oh yeah .	1
while  there are flaws with the machine  the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .	1
it has never worked .	0
best camera ever . from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything .	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving  the photos were awesome .	1
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )	0
nothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have .	1
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light  the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins )  and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .	0
first and foremost  it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .	1
about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .	0
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .	1
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .	0
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .	0
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .	1
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "	0
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours  compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .	1
this is my first digital camera  and what a ' toy ' it is !	1
