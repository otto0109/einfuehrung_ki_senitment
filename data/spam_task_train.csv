It can read right throughmisspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the authorabove suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anythinglike the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason thefirst letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important isthat without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentiallymore difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to beresolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are farless important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.  Cheers,-James Rogers jamesr@best.com	0

Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity ofthis continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Evenfor descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendentsof slaves, who were brought here by force.More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity inwealth has nothing to do with it.It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, onlyindividuals do. Like group rights, "disparity" in wealth isstatistical sophistry.Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealthis almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even whenthere are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still theresince 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes onwealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,they're nowhere near the top.I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislatedmonopoly, corporate welfare, "non-profit" neoaristocratic tax dodges,and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, likewhat happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most "unfairly"distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, morepeople living longer.I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when thereturns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.Cheers,RAH-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPYy3ysPxH8jf3ohaEQLqNQCg14YvF8NVYwKiRrghHdisBoNCOn8AoPcRQUzorXeaLe5h3T1syKl7DFNT=9kff-----END PGP SIGNATURE------- -----------------R.

[zzzzteana] Moscow bomberMan Threatens Explosion In Moscow Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PMMOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man whosaid he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck infront of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTVtelevision reported.The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the mangot out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other detailswere immediately available.The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax andITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted totalk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, withinblocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded theman, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the newsagencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outsidethe building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and droveto a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities heldfurther negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said.

But it should >be equally clear that that isn't what people mean when they>use the word "promiscuity". Sigh.This sprung out of a report linked by Cindy about the promiscuity offemale monkeys with males other than the alpha male, i.e, specificallynot the tail end of the distribution.  "By mating with as manyextra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure [etc.]">OK, then. Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each>pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him "Wilt",>also has sex with the other 499,999 womenThis has never happened.  Its relevance is nil.>Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their >actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.So I chose not to type "on average" explicitly in my post, since thisis FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interestedin typical behaviour and you in extreme.  Actually, you probably justhad a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.EOT, AFAIC.R	0

Re: Goodbye Global WarmingI've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forumsfor several years.  I've always found archaeology interesting for noparticular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that Iactually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com--------------------------------------------http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htmDefrosting the pastAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bountyof a warming worldBY ALEX MARKELSAs he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, EdKnapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000feet. "It looked like a bison skull," the building contractor andamateur archaeologist recalls. "I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don'tlive this high up.' "Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from abisonone that died about 340 years ago. "This was an extraordinarydiscovery," says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that itcould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. "There'sprobably a lot more like it yet to be found."And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers andsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peruto Alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars andindustryhave shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. Asthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts isemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deepfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the muckyfringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of ourpredecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued."It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced throughstudying these remains," says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitudearchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National GeographicSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discoveredin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old "IceMan," found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, haveoffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, asthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasionaltreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before MotherNatureand looterstake them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains candeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they'reoften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon themdon't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier inBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was adead animal. "It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. "But when I lookedcloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a furtrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Locbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumedthe fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and whatseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunterlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long AgoPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (whomay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved humanfrom the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region couldexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in thefirst place. "Before this there was no archaeological record of peopleliving here," says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. "Now wesee that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities."Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedekcaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the southYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered incaribou dung. "It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't beencaribou in the area for at least 100 years," recalls Kuzyk, then awildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found "what looked like apencil with string wrapped around it." It turned out to be a4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of theice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layercakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800years of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to theice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discardedsome equipment in the ice. "We've got people hunting with throwing dartsup until 1,200 years ago," says Hare, who now oversees the researchproject. "Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwingdarts."Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. Theyare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on whereglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known tohave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangelland St. Elias mountain rangesthe United States' most glaciatedterrainand in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawingEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite asthe Ice Man. "Global warming is providing us high-altitudearchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We'reprobably about the only ones happy about it."	0

Re: Electric car an Edsel...Sunday I drove from Portland down to the Woodburn Dragstrip to check out the NEDRA Nationals. <http://www.nedra.com/>The electric cars, motorcycles and dragsters had some great times and I ended up with a few pics and a nice deep burn...John Waylan (who was interviewed in Wired a few years back) pulled out a 14.4 second run in the quarter mile (91mph), on a battery pack that hasn't been broken in yet. He expects to break his record next year topping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. He's shooting for a 12 second run.John also took out a replica 1908 Oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph run. (Remember, we started out with electric cars.)Near the end of the day, Kilacycle took the track with an amazing 111mph run.

Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction.Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency  by have some play with time and valueMost people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's  called congnitive dissonance theoryMost businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale  and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaroundfrom technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only wayinconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. The local information when combined with the technicaltroubles of providing "just enough" forced synchronizationto remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones whenconcerns are more immedidate.  Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is howpeople cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarilypre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neckwho thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that thewhole world would be a little more perfect and everything,including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistentlybe in its proper place.Greg	0

RE: Java is for kiddiesAdam Beberg:>Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or >device drivers - C still rules the world.There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. Withstatic object allocation and a few other programmingtechniques, performance differences disappear, butC++ gives a boost in development and maintainability.The real issue is compiler availability.

That's a half a cent a Megabyte for storage.>Not El Cheapo storage but top of the line storage.less than two years later, we have 320 GB for the same price:http://www.shareholder.com/maxtor/news/20020909-89588.cfmMaxtor Driving Capacity-Centric Enterprise Apps With "Super-Sized" ATA DrivesMaxtor Continues its Leadership in the Market it Pioneered with a New Category of High-Density ATA DrivesMILPITAS, Calif., September 9, 2002-Maxtor Corporation (NYSE: MXO), a worldwide leader in hard disk drives and data storage solutions, today announced Maxtor MaXLineTM, its newest generation of ATA drives designed specifically for rapidly emerging enterprise storage applications including near-line, media storage and network storage. The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; and unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to failure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into "near-line" archive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive architectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including executive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be recovered on demand.These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the storage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, these files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced starting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between traditional ATA and SCSI drives.For system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, easy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server environments."The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, financial documents and transaction records," said Mike Dooley, senior director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. "Users may not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but when they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these enterprise applications."The MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for capacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage density than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, which exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a three-year warranty.The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM UltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation serial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum data transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive environments and enterprise applications.With a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. The interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with increased design flexibility and hot plug capability."Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that has previously been too expensive to keep on disk," said Dave Reinsel, analyst at IDC. "The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications."AvailabilityLimited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in the fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.About MaxtorMaxtor Corporation (www.maxtor.com) is one of the world's leading suppliers of information storage solutions.

NYTimes.com Article: Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be SealedThis article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.Another reminder that the moral writ of intellectual property is -- and ought to --be more limited than real property. Private money paid for these bits, but expropriation may be fairer for IP than real-P.Rohitkhare@alumni.caltech.eduVast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be SealedSeptember 30, 2002By JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON  What is almost certainly the most sophisticated andcomplete understanding of exactly how and why the twintowers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled aspart of a largely secret proceeding in federal court inLower Manhattan. Amassed during the initial stages of a complicatedinsurance lawsuit involving the trade center, theconfidential material contains data and expert analysisdeveloped by some of the nation's most respectedengineering minds. It includes computer calculations thathave produced a series of three-dimensional images of thecrumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,helping to identify the sequence of failures that led tothe collapses. An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of thedebris piles, rare photos and videos, has also beenaccumulated in a collection that far outstrips whatgovernment analysts have been able to put together as theystruggle to answer the scientifically complex andemotionally charged questions surrounding the deadlyfailures of the buildings. But everyone from structural engineers to relatives ofvictims fear that the closely held information, whichincludes the analysis and the possible answers thatfamilies and engineers around the world have craved, mayremain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, theexperts cannot disclose their findings publicly as theywait for the case to play out. Such restrictions aretypical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as itnow stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed thatcertain material can remain secret for the time being - hasapproved standard legal arrangements that, should thelawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucialmaterial generated by the competing sides to be withheld. "We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, butwe can't until we're told what to do," said Matthys Levy,an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,who is a consultant in the case and the author of "WhyBuildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail" (Norton, 2ndedition, 2002). "Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the wholeprocess" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when thesouth tower fell and who is a member of the SkyscraperSafety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed."If they have answers and are not going to share them, Iwould be devastated," Mrs. Gabrielle said. "They have amoral obligation." The lawsuit that has generated the information involvesLarry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on thetrade center property, and a consortium of insurancecompanies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetlinerthat hit the towers constituted a separate terroristattack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than halfthat amount, as the insurance companies say. As both sides have prepared their arguments, they havespent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expertopinion about exactly what happened to the towers. Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers ofHartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, saidof the findings, "There are some confidentiality agreementsthat are keeping those out of the public domain today." Heconceded that differing opinions among the more than 20insurers on his side of the case could complicate anyrelease of the material. As for his own company, whose consultants alone haveproduced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands ofdiagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attemptwould be made to give the material eventually to "publicauthorities and investigative teams." Still, some of that analysis relies on information likeblueprints and building records from other sources, likethe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which builtand owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein inthe suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how thediffering origins of the material would influence hiscompany's ability to release information. In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documentswould be "decided on a case-by-case basis consistent withapplicable law and policy," adding that it would cooperatewith "federal investigations." The fate of the research is particularly critical toresolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry intothe buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by theFederal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by fewresources, a lack of access to crucial information likebuilding plans, and infighting among experts and officials.A new federal investigation intended to remedy thosefailings has just begun at the National Institute ofStandards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that hasstudied many building disasters. Officials with NIST have said it could take years to makefinal determinations and recommendations for otherbuildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speededup with access to the analysis done by the consultants onthe lawsuit. Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said ofthe real estate executive's own heavily financedinvestigative work, "We decline to comment other than tosay that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NISTinvestigation." A spokesman for the agency confirmed it wasin discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, butsaid no transfer had taken place. With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations byboth sides in the legal case have produced a startling bodyof science and theory, some of it relevant not only to thetrade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. "The work should be available to other investigators," saidRamon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partnerat Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlierinquiry. "It could be used to build better buildings in thefuture." Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the onegoverning the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,from full or partial disclosure to destruction of suchinformation. In some cases, litigants who paid for thereports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask tohave them sealed forever. "It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keepsome of those documents secret for one reason or another,some legitimate, some not," said Lee Levine, a FirstAmendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of theinformation, the court might look favorably on requests tomake it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of thematerial is unnerving to many people, especially expertswho believe that only a complete review of the evidence -not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protecttheir own interests - could lead to an advance in thefederal investigation of the trade center. "It's important for this to get presented and published andsubjected to some scrutiny," said Dr. John Osteraas,director of civil engineering practice at Exponent FailureAnalysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on thecase, "because then the general engineering community cansort it out." The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast byany measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at WeidlingerAssociates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have calledupon powerful computer programs, originally developed withthe Pentagon for classified research, to create a model ofthe Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images ofthe severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damagedcore of the towers, beginning with the impacts andproceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helpedpinpoint the structural failures. The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computermodeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access tothe trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeksimmediately after the attacks. But no such constraintshampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought tothe site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon ofSept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and aconsultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said hehad assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at groundzero in models that perhaps contain further clues about howthe towers fell. Though the FEMA team could not determine "where thingsactually fell," Mr. Cuoco said, "we've indicated thespecific locations." Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional detailsof the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the detailsof computer calculations his company has done on the spreadof fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive ofphotographs and videos of the towers that day, some ofwhich he believes have not been available to otherinvestigators. And the investigation has not limited itself to computersand documentary evidence. For months, experiments in windtunnels in the United States and Canada have been examiningthe aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressedthe weakening structures. Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in FortCollins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies buthad previously performed wind-tunnel studies for theoriginal design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. Forthe legal case, Dr. Cermak said, "we've done probably moredetailed measurements than in the original design." "The data that have been acquired are very valuable inthemselves for understanding how wind and buildingsinteract," Dr. Cermak said.

QED.Quod erat not demonstrandum at all.There are massive amounts of libraries for C, Fortran and so on.To pick an obvious example., if you want to do linear algebra, thenJava isn't a serious candidate at all.Furthermore, plenty of bugs occur in the libraries too, at a lowerrate due to more users having been bitten by them, but they are muchharder for you to fix than in your own code.Why do so many people outside of Sun's marketing department considerJava to be "Write Once, Debug Everywhere" ?R	0
Last time you spent $25 did u make $100,000,s? Well this time you will. wjuHelloYou may have seen this business before andignored it. I know I did - many times! However,please take a few moments to read this letter.I was amazed when the profit potential of thisbusiness finally sunk in... and it works!With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,success in this business is now fast, easy andwell within the capabilities of ordinary peoplewho know little about internet marketing. And theearnings potential is truly staggering!I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -follow what it says to the letter - and you will notworry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who isPresident, or whether you keep your current job or not.Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never respondedto one of these before either. One day though,something just said: "You throw away $25.00 going toa movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."Believe me, no matter where you believe those "feelings"come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would bedoing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buyingand selling something of value.AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5months from your home.THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!==================================================BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before you say "Bull", please read the following.This is the letter you have been hearing about on thenews lately. Due to the popularity of this letter onthe internet, a national weekly news program recentlydevoted an entire show to the investigation of thisprogram described below, to see if it really can makepeople money. The show also investigated whether ornot the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation inthe program and if people can 'follow the simpleinstructions' they are bound to make some mega buckswith only $25 out of pocket cost".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECTTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKINGBETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: "Thanks to thisprofitable opportunity. I was approached many timesbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expectin return for the minimal effort and money required.To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.==================================================Another said: "This program has been around for along time but I never believed in it. But one daywhen I received this again in the mail I decidedto gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simpleinstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later themoney started to come in. First month I only made$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I madea total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 monthsby re-entering the program, I have made over$710,000.00 and I am playing it again.

To assist you with marketing your businesson the internet, the 5 reports you purchase willprovide you with invaluable marketing informationwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get thisventure going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to seehow it goes, and we will assume you and those involvedsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)response (the response could be much better but let'sjust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people respondedby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders. That's 100 people whoresponded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each fora total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER ANDFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NOMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILLMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to thinkfor a moment what would happen if everyone or halfor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internetworldwide and counting, with thousands more comingonline every day. Believe me, many people will dojust that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive andthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.Placing a lot of free ads on the internet willeasily get a larger response. We strongly suggestyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as yougo along. For every $5 you receive, all you mustdo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,with your name and address on it, will be promptbecause they cannot advertise until they receivethe report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the "cash" is not because this isillegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared orapproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no onecan SEE there is money in the envelope and stealit before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) foreach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure thecash is concealed by wrapping it in at least2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets ofpaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the reportyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and yourname and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :================================================== REPORT # 1: "The Insider's Guide To Advertisingfor Free On The Net"Order Report #: 1 fromRui Sousa SantosP.O.

My wife, Jody and I live inChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the populationand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I mademerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she hadreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days shehad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois================================================"Not being the gambling type, it took me severalweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.But conservative as I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no waythat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back. I was surprised when I found mymedium size post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does notmatter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big."Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada================================================="I had received this program before. I deleted it,but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailedagain by someone else......... 11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all themoney came within 22 weeks."Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.================================================="It really is a great opportunity to make relativelyeasy money with little cost to you. I followed thesimple instructions carefully and within 10 days themoney started to come in.

This is a pain.  The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download theoriginal libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do: rpm -Uvh libvorbis-* RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library alreadyinstalled is beyond me.Kate-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	0

[zzzzteana] Language problemsAnanova:  Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture captionReaders of an African newspaper have complained after a picture captionabout jewellery contained the words "let's have sex".The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languagesspoken in Namibia.Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, whichtranslates roughly as "let's have intercourse" in the Oshiwambo language.It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings fromthe femidon - female condom - as jewellery.According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIVpatients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.He intended it to mean "you will see for yourselves" in the Siyeyi tongue.One caller said the complainants "should be considerate of other people'slanguages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...Andthat the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo".Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in variousNamibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which inSiyeyi means testicles.Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambotranslates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's haveintercourse.The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.Story filed: 12:37 Tuesday 8th October 2002------------------------ Yahoo!

June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: "DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the "fraudulent assertions" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation." "A Honolulu-based attorney created the "Kingdom of EnenKio" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the "kingdom" has disputed." http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with "**") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the "fraudulent assertions" of two organizations, ...** (Comment: Just because the RMI government "...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio...", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) **...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a "sister nation" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for DOM. **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, "...an article in Agence France-Presse" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an "...investment scam...". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no "fraudulent claims" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any "..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..." nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the "Kingdom of EnenKio" in the early 1990s.** (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the "kingdom" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an "agreement"? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGE June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. "Fantasy Island" -- "Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: "Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of "the kingdom of EnenKio," another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands." http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: "Fantasy Island", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the "Melchizedek press release" you cited, indicating that "...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of "the kingdom of EnenKio,...". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is "...another only-in- cyberspace country...", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGE June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). "Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek." Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with "**") in color: **In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: "Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory." **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. The Author responds: "I don't see much conflict between the two versions here." **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: "I will note this." **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. The Author responds: "I will make the necessary corrections here." **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. The Author responds: "I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so." (June 7, 1999) SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGEJune 1, 1999: News ReleasePart One Background: On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a "press release" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, "Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said "press release" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called "Press Release": This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: Â» Â» exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). Â» Â» was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. Â» Â» was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. Â» Â» has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek Â» Â» has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as - now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - "RMI geographical and politicalboundaries." Â» Â» exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Â» Â» has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: Â» Â» also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). Â» Â» was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, which included the United States, China and the USSR. Â» Â» was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. Â» Â» has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. Â» Â» has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. Â» Â» exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. Â» Â» has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: "With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal." On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary. (See also: Report on RMI Mismanagement) SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGENews Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999Part Two Background: The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC, February 1999, states as follows: "Where Are OFCs Located? [Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more "remote" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice." [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of "ethnic cleansing" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

Â  His Majesty King Remios Hermios Second Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Remios, who will formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch, titular Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned.Â  His Majesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls. His successor is designated to be his brother, HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios. For further information, contact the State Secretary back on the home page. SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGE March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A "State of War" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.Â  The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in "taking possession" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.Â  The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.Â  Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.Â  Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the "'State of War', a Declaration" and broadcast it to the world.Â  The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.Â  It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.Â  While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.Â  The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.Â  Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.Â  The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.Â  The refusal of the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.Â  Your understanding is appreciated.Â  SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGEDecember 19, 1998: News Release Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGE July 14, 1998: CommuniquÃ© to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against "fraudulent claims". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual "state of war" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) "asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..." of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'Ãªtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled "Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand," of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. The published statement, "The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain...", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not "created" by Robert Moore and he is not a "Honolulu-based attorney." HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. "Enenkio" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. "Wake" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers. SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGEMay 4, 1997: News Release Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official "First Day of Issue" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in "exile". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to "Wake" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. "STATE OF WAR" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual "state of war" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the "state of war" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace. SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGEMarch 31, 1997: News Release An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: "A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES." This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by "Western explorers" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its "ownership" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the "natives" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more "hospitable" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, "yields to the recognition that a State of War" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. "ownership" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: Â» Â» "...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR...". Â» Â» "If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens." Â» Â» "...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all andevery action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..." Â» Â» "...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior Â» Â» "...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay." Â» Â» That the "...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process...". The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGE February 6, 1995: News Release On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the "star wars" program, I am led to believe. An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called "no significant impact" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. Request for Media Response: The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of "world leadership"? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was "decommissioned" after the so-called "processing" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) Parting Shot: What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western "civilized" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of "manifest destiny" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at "fixing up the world". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. TOP OF PAGENovember 21, 1994: News Release In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: "Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island" and stated: "Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: Â» Â» Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was "decommissioned" more than a decade ago. Â» Â» In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. Â» Â» Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. Â» Â» A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since "formal" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia.

Native American economics (was Re: sed /s/United States/Roman    Empire/g)I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  I actually lived ona couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwestand also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And myparents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations thanI have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  Ido get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-handfrom my father.The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly becauseit is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While itis true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as aconsequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, notsomething that was impressed upon them.The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entitythat exists separately from the individuals, typically an "IndianCorporation" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns asingle share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies fromtribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of thetribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k perperson, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number ofplaces, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and variousbusinesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribesare run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for theirshare no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is veryhigh unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happytake their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from thecorporation often constitutes their sole "income" for government accountingpurposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no oneworks, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain thosedividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so becausethey have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies isthat on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor whitefolk, not Indians.Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they alsoreceive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporationto the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  Bybenefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no otherordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations areineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority arevery smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with goodcredentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is theHaida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, hasbillions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own havegross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet thedividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particularcase, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades beforedrawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led tointelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and haveactually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federalgovernment with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  Thisparticular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expendituresper person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and manyborrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousanddollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation ratherthan their own pockets.Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuableassets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously givenwhere feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreigncompanies.  And the cycle continues.So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In anutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, andgross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse duringpregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a verysubstantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many ofthe thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at theearliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On onereservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many ofthese societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law isarbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, policeetc).In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in ashambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that Ihave ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren'tthat many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that Icould tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unlessyou'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, butit has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the goodguys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism asa minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police areopenly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  Itwill give you an interesting perspective on things.)There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperousIndians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined andintelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second iswhere the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even ifthey maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the triballeaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathologicalcases mentioned above.The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spentby the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite highwhen you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It isjust that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well toordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  Thepoverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was myoriginal point.On a tangent:One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribalcorporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporatesocialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use thisstructure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what hasinterested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly wellover the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.It seems that in a future where "familial" ties will be increasinglyvoluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Westernsociety, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family withthe included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selectingindividuals.Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com On 9/22/02 3:53 PM, "John Hall" <johnhall@evergo.net> wrote:> > As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans> who speak english at home and those who do not.

RE: Goodbye Global Warming"the historical record", by which you mean *human* historical record, ishighly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geologicaltimescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that thesupposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absoluteterms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noisefloor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rateof temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of globaltemperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degreehere or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that globaltemperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain whytemperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the lastcouple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geologicalstandards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to useclimate to push a particular social agenda.It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers depositedduring the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence ofhumans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glacierspaved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into abit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buriedin and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by theice for thousands of years.  I don't see any compelling reason to "savethe glaciers" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that theirexistence has always been transient.For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations areanthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'lljust stick with Occam's Razor for now.In my humble opinion.Cheers,-James Rogers jamesr@best.comOn Mon, 2002-09-23 at 12:23, Jim Whitehead wrote:> > For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the> dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global> temperature.

A quick check of the text indicates the theHebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (egGen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things.In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similarclaim about the "real" meaning of one of the ten commandments:"""> The translations since cause problems at each successive removeWe have the original language versions, though, so this is not anissue.> I'm sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the meaning of the commandment> is 'thou shalt not murder' rather than 'kill,'This has nothing to do with successive translations. It is based on ourknowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word "ratsach". Most moderntranslations I've seen translate it "murder" but elsewhere the word isusedof an animal killing a human (something for which most English speakerswouldn't use the word "murder")."""- http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/july99/0163.htmlJames--   James Tauber  jtauber@jtauber.comhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork	0

This is also true of corporate policies, and all other attempts to regulate conduct by rules. Rules just don't work well when situations are fluid or ambiguous. But I don't think that the misbehavior of energy companies in California can properly be called well-intentioned lawbreaking by parties who were trying to do the right thing but could do so only by falling afoul of some technicality.)If you want to get to root causes, we should probably go to the slaying of Abel by Cain.

[zzzzteana] Punch bags filled with incontinence padshttp://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633932.Bizarre+London.0.htmlAn investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking for the filling to be tested.The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: "This is one of the strangest stories I have every heard."Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover why the bags contain such unusual contents."12:18 Tuesday 8th October 2002_________________________________________________________________Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com------------------------ Yahoo!

"A billion here, a billion there..."> Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have > endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he > ever coined it.An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there's no written evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the infamous quote attributed to him. It's kind of astounding that there is enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* FAQ) and "eyewitness" reporting without a single written source. What the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest attributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much more skeptical if the "quote" emerged after his death... RK===============================================================http://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm"A billion here, a billion there . . ."Did Dirksen ever say, " A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money"? (or anything very close to that?)Perhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio records of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to him.Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote or its variations.Here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed "Ev and Charlie" and "Ev and Jerry" shows, all newspapers clippings in the Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of Republican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular turn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or excessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word "pothole" to remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to the debt ceiling:"As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make the deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were working on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic hazard."Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a conference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and said, I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth and remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.'" [Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].On the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another "spending" story, one he labeled "cat in the well":"One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, Johnny, a cat fell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and then fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the well?'"Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a while, and then when the teacher came down and said, How are you getting along?' Johnny said, Teacher, if you give me another slate and a couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes I can land that cat in hell.'"If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do not find much to cheer about concerning it." [Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].But there are no such reminders for the "A billion here, a billion there . . . " tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen's note-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no authoritative reference to the "billion" phrase.The chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from people who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as evidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard Dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But cross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up nothing in the way of confirmation.The closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican leadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, "The favorite sum of money is $1 billion  a billion a year for a fatter federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there." [EMD Papers, Republican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the "and pretty soon you're talking real money" is missing.In another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted Dirksen: "Look at education  two-and-one-half billion  a billion for this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five billion for public works. You haven't got any budget balance left. You'll be deeply in the red." [Cited in Byron Hulsey's "Everett Dirksen and the Modern Presidents," Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of Texas, p. 226]Of course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late Senator's comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not have his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional Records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen's life and career  he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses claim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen's campaign speeches tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated newspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped capture.Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he ever coined it.  ---My permanent email address is khare@alumni.caltech.edu	0

Living Love - Another legacy of the 60'sNormally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but related, relaxation techniques including "betagenics", hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / G-Force Dyno-Staff.I have to say however that, having found this while looking for something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and contrast with our (my) modern mental models.I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.http://mindprod.com/methods.htmlhttp://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.htmlhttp://www.mindprod.com/(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)We create the world we live in.A loving person lives in a loving world,A hostile person lives in a hostile world.Everyone you meet is your mirror.You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to waste what you do have.The past is dead,The future is imaginary,Happiness can only bein the Eternal Now MomentHow soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.Love a person because he or she is there.This is the only reason.Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.Thepurposeof our livesis to be freeof all addictive traps,and thusbecome onewith the ocean ofLiving Love.sdw-- sdw@lig.net http://sdw.stStephen D.

[zzzzteana] Hitler-style applicant welcomed by partiesThe Times   September 06, 2002  Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties By Roger Boyes    MANAGERS of Germanys political parties are having difficulty explaining their enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed largely from Mein Kampf, Hitlers personal manifesto. The incident illustrates how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to those of the Führer.   Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the present Chancellor, said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union headquarters in Ingolstadt. Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland, said the letter, signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald.   The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Many thanks for your nice thoughts, replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for membership.   The letter used chunks of Hitlers book, which is still banned in Germany. History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.   The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive, the letter-writer said. So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March sun. Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923.   Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaders words, were sent to the other political parties and drew sympathetic responses. I read your letter with great interest and pleasure, the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in Cologne, said.   Great that you want to join us! enthused the Green Party headquarters. The Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor.   I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing extremism, said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist Rainer Popp. I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic.   For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called  with packets of election material from zealous political headquarters, Herr Popp said.   I was stunned that political parties could react in this way  I reckon I would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Adolf Hitler.   ------------------------ Yahoo!

The freight still isn't moving,factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, andretailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passingday. On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, thenext step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to workfor 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over thedisputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages.Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health orsafety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chaocovered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the workstoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). "Union officials quicklyresponded that their members have been unloading military cargothroughout the 10-day shutdown," said the L.A. Times, but ananonymous Bush administration official "said that only a portion of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartleywould annoy labor right before congressional elections. On theother hand, "Voter discontent with Bush's handling of theincreasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up inpolls, and such concerns may have outweighed the politicaldanger to the Republican administration," said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a pollreported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the economy. "Though the administration promised an unbiasedexamination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up hismind that it was hurting national security and the economy,andmerited federal intervention," said the AP. As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labordisputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workerssimply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case).One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers'contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen MuehlbauerPresident Acts To Halt Port Lockout for 80 Days (SeattleTimes)http://tinyurl.com/1usnBush Expected To Act on Ports Crisis http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/business/1002/08ports.htmlPresident Moves Toward Forcing the Reopening of West CoastPortshttp://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ports8oct08001439,0,1021983.storyBush Takes Step Toward Halting Lockout After West Coast PortTalks Break Off (AP)http://tinyurl.com/1uskWhite House Intervenes on Docks Dispute (Financial Times)http://tinyurl.com/1usmCooling-off Period Likely in Port Fight (SF Chronicle)http://tinyurl.com/1uspBush Moves Toward Halting Port Shutdownhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/national/08PORT.htmlTrouble On The Dockshttp://online.wsj.com/page/0,,2_0864,00.html(Paid subscription required.)Charges of Politics Have Dogged Taft-Hartley Acthttp://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/90243_hartley08.shtmlTaft-Hartley Act No Quick-Fix For Port Dispute (Reuters)http://www.forbes.com/work/newswire/2002/10/02/rtr739458.html-----------------------------------------------------------------ADVERTISEMENT-----------------------------------------------------------------SPECIAL OFFER!

We mean "foul." The two dominant direct broadcast satelliteplayers want to join forces, the better to compete with BigCable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the JusticeDepartment, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate ofDirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US.The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposedmerger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and$25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents,and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTVand EchoStar is Dish. All straight?The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to holdoff ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the JusticeDepartment has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified"major revisions" to the deal that they want to discuss withJustice in the next weeks.The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form thoserevisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequenciesto Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal forinvestors in the satellite space. It seems the market forexpanded-service television may be nearing saturation.TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded,"Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, butshareholders may realize much smaller returns."The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid forDirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If thecurrent deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith DawsonEchoStar and Hughes Propose Concessions in Bid to Save Dealhttp://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB103403314258094560,00.html(Paid subscription required)Regulators Set to Block EchoStar's Hughes Purchasehttp://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1033939901346228393,00.html(Paid subscription required)'Last-ditch effort' (Rocky Mountain News)http://tinyurl.com/1upiEchoStar, Hughes See a Glimmer of Hopehttp://www.thestreet.com/tech/georgemannes/10046366.htmlF.C.C.

His 'thumbs of death'would rival anything a toddler could do to devices.  After countless numbers ofWalkman devices having their lids broken or buttons pressed into oblivion Ifound the Sony devices.  I got him a "My First Sony" (be afraid of themarketing) CD player.   It was /fire engine red/ but was completelyindestructible.  I hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him.  Hecomplained of it's looks but used it nonetheless.

And the bandwidth shadows in most citiesare surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, whichis pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize nextgeneration wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a largescale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wirelessconfigurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots andothers which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transitconsiderations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimizethe canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wirelessis tied into fiber at multiple points.The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, buta mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidthmeasured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up towell over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges andbandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by anorder of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows andproximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize thecost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providerscan remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly lowbar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level oflarge-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effectivebandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company'slong-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary tokeep things sane.Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into thesystem (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is moreefficient).-James Rogers jamesr@best.com	0

[zzzzteana] Compensation for World's youngest motherhttp://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.htmlLIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as "Little Chicago." Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. "The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care," Jose Sandoval, author of "Mother Aged 5," told Reuters. "We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective," he added. 'Totally willing to help'Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. "We're totally willing to help her," said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. "She got no help (in 1939) that I know about," he said. "She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true." Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. Medical rarityNo one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. Her swelling stomach worried her parents. "They thought it was a tumor," he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in "moral danger," and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. But Sandoval said: "It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them." Happy ending?Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. "We just want to get on with our lives, that's it," said Jurado, adding he thought "absolutely nothing" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. He said its value was "more or less $25,000" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. "If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property," he said. As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. "I believe there will be a happy ending," he said. "As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an eraof corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of thecountry will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon theprejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few handsand the Republic is destroyed."Abraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col.

Definitely the answer many have been waiting for!!================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to "look before you leap" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.	1

sed /s/United States/Roman Empire/g> A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human > race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable.Absolutely correct. Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on Earth today.The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world.>  The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. It does, > however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the > future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas and this is an > area where America must excel.I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa, our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It's #1 in practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and taking share from every other government broadcaster.It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared they might.As you read, replace "United States" with "Roman Empire" and it may make as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us.Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world.Rohit-----------------------------------------------------September 20, 2002Full Text: Bush's National Security StrategyFollowing is the full text of President Bush's new national security strategy. The document, entitled "The National Security Strategy of the United States," will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of the Administration's policy.INTRODUCTIONTHE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us.To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn.The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, trade, and cultural advancement.Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders.The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. The United States will deliver greater development assistance through the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of AIDS and other infectious diseases.In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission.I. Overview of America's International Strategy"Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent."President BushWest Point, New YorkJune 1, 2002The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom.For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality.That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations with other states, and respect for human dignity.And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.To achieve these goals, the United States will:*champion aspirations for human dignity;*strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends;*work with others to defuse regional conflicts;*prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends, with weapons of mass destruction;*ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade;*expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy;*develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power; and*transform America's national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity"Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require different methods, but not different moralities."President BushWest Point, New YorkJune 1, 2002In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police.America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people.Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a stronger, but is a freer and more just society.Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish.Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, the national security strategy of the United States must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international bodies.We will:*speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom;*use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;*make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future; and*take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it.III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends"Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of our choosing."President BushWashington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)September 14, 2001The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some unseen.Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial tools necessary to finish the task.The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative financial networks.However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek.We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:*direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or their precursors;*defending the United States, the American people, and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country; and*denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities.We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism. This includes:*using the full influence of the United States, and working closely with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose;*supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;*diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk; and*using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter attack.This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector.This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide.As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terroristsIn the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts"We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small."President BushBerlin, GermanyMay 23, 2002Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability.No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:*The United States should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge.*The United States should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles:The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict.The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support for the creation of a Palestinian state.Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation.Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere.Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country.In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the Colombian people.In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- combating global terror. American interests and American principles, therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats.Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region:*countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention;*coordination with European allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations; and*Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis.Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends with Weapons of Mass Destruction"The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and we will oppose them with all our power."President BushWest Point, New YorkJune 1, 2002The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security environment has undergone profound transformation.Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable.But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex and dangerous.In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that, while different in important ways, share a number of attributes. These states:*brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers;*display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;*are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;*sponsor terrorism around the globe; and*reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything for which it stands.At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations.We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis.Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:*Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed adversaries.*Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward.*Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. We cannot let our enemies strike first.*In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and the wealth of their nations.*In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.*Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to action.For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning.The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction.The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act preemptively.The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot remain idle while dangers gather.We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our actions. To support preemptive options, we will:*build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;*coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats; and*continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and Free Trade."When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively."President BushMonterrey, MexicoMarch 22, 2002A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it reinforces the habits of liberty.We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth, including:*pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;*tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that improve incentives for work and investment;*rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors;*strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use;*sound fiscal policies to support business activity;*investments in health and education that improve the well-being and skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and*free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity.The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the developing world.A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth.Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future.We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur.The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.The concept of "free trade" arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:*Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.*Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free trade.*Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will be our principal focal points.*Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade Promotion Authority.*Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.*Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.*Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets.*Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy "network" between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.*Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies.Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be to:*remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for international cooperation;*obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts;*develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions;*promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;*increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's budget; and*assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path.VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building the Infrastructure of Democracy"In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens."President BushWashington, D.C. (Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank)March 14, 2002A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of U.S. international policy.Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's poorest economies within a decade.The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal:*Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms.*Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries.*Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that more children are getting a better education, more people have access to health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do.*Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results.*Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy.*Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.*Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in Africa. The United States can also bring information technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been devastated by AIDS.*Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition.VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers of Global Power"We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war."President BushWest Point, New YorkJune 1, 2002America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world trade.The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:*expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;*ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;*develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces;*take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;*streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; and*maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and friendships, we will:*look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation;*work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longer-term;*build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;*maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic environment; and*build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region.We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration into the Euro-Atlantic community.At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even decades.The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future.The United States relationship with China is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness.The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens.Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become more open with information, promote the development of civil society, and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over $100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for relations between the United States and other main centers of global power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive.Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress.IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century"Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, and enterprise of our people."President BushWashington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)September 20, 2001The major institutions of American national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be transformed.It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, our military must:*assure our allies and friends;*dissuade future military competition;*deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and*decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges.The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment of U.S. forces.Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. infrastructure and assets in outer space.Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the United States.Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets.We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury.We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement.Initiatives in this area will include:*strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence capabilities;*establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies;*continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage;*investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities; and*collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all-source analysis.As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American readiness to play our part.Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where America must excel.We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. personnel and officials.We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security. The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the American people.Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite of it.In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that energy. That is where our national security begins.	0

Apple Sauced...againOver on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired articlethat goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love andrespect for its users.http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.htmlThere is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over athttp://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html"True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gaina competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface intheir applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverseengineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popularthat an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (thirdparty or otherwise) was in development.All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because theprivate APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would haveupdated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they haveresigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the firstplace.But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forciblyexclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of"known" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, itis not allowed to load.It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants"developers, developers, developers!", but Microsoft clearly understandssomething that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platformvendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. InApple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards tomake every single system service and UI element "pluggable" via publicAPIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be thenumber one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, ifthird party developers want to sell into a market that requires thedesired functionality to be added in "unsupported" ways, then they must beprepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developereffort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing toprovide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish.

One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitiousrendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fictionis more "real" than the reality.  You see it over and over again inhistory:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The JuniorAnthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only becameJunior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before youknow it the charade takes on a life of its own which the PrimitivePeople are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there issubstantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, thefacts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fictionthat is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. AmericanIndians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the mythin popular culture.I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter whereyou are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when youhave a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normalpopulation, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com	0

Earn $139,000 a year as a DAY TRADER!It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle schoolwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in thecafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just madethem a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,"and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investmentwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing theirlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,I promised to pay them even more the week after that,if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high schoolstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're notgoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out whenyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors andmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time tobuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keepyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is"NEVER".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an indexfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollarsin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard tomake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars inthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where wouldyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatilityis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to seethose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followedby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don'tcare if the market went up or down 20% this year as longit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successfultrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxingring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as helldon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firmto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in factso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spenda few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publicationsduring the past decade, and after using day tradingto successfully make more than four million dollars inthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't becomewealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is throughhard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeksbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practicalexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pullingclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to sharewith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn frommy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,secret formula for day trading that I've used profitablyyear after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost withinminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them. *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make.*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market! *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success. *** Profit on huge intraday price swings.*** Make money on the biggest news stories.*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximumreturns. *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street professionals use.*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. It's time to ask yourself: "Am I going to listen to the Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or amI going to take control of my own financial future, andstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"Who is looking out for your best economic interests - somewealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars.The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight-forward book ever written about active trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to yourown financial future.Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market.  Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the Californiacoast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day tradingis the fastest track to wealth.

[ILUG-Social] HELLOOFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIELFEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSINGFEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEXIKOYI-LAGOS.ATTN:,                  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me.

Online contents of Electronic Publishing journalI recently stumbled across the contents of the journal, "ElectronicPublishing", which was published from January, 1988 through December, 1995.All papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the firstjournals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some ofthe better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearlyfrom 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92).http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/epoddtoc.htmlToday's reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance,since they don't directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find thisjournal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by topresearchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of theideas that led to many Web technologies.  It's one source among many forsifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishingtechnologies.Rohit and Adam might find the following papers especially relevant, in thecontext of their WWW7 "Evolution of Document Species" paper:Page Description Languages: Development, Implementation and Standardization:A.

One of a kind Money maker! Try it for free!From nobody Mon Sep 15 18:00:02 2014Content-Type: text/html;charset="iso-8859-1"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit<body lang=EN-US><div class=Section1><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> beingbombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limitedinformation, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding yourmoney/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general withall its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main businessslowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked forsomething to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying mybills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, thisproposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! becauseI had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regretat all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you asa system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You joinonly if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of yourtime and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea ofpersonal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simplythe most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriouslyconsider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! Nokidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea oftheir overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worstyet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying tofigure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing youwith the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>Howdoes it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers thatneed to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dontwant to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustratingbattle to try to get your money back! </b></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my PlatinumChoice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totallydifferent from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise loftymega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their ownpockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every weekfor life</u> yeah, right!</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happywith my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anythingwithout corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in actionfor yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out theform as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then youare ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system andthe Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, freecorporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! </p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call meat any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me tofinally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free.  Good luck!</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><ahref="http://www.mindupmerchants.com/default.asp?ID=5581">http://www.mindupmerchants.com/default.asp?ID=5581</a></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Ben Green, (775) 322-3323 </p><p class=MsoBodyText>P.S.Free POP3 email is ofered for members now!</p></div></body>	1

[ILUG-Social] URGENT ASSISTANT NEEDEDDear friend,I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situationtill when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United StateDollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claimof the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties andstock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level ofconfidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust andconfidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you wherethe funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.Yours sincerely,Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.-- Irish Linux Users' Group Social Events: social@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/social for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	1

[ILUG] ASSISTANCEFROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236email : mikebundu@rediffmail.comDear Sir/MadamSEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. Thisis necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strangeand unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of theDemocratic Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic ofCongo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels inmy country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms andammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebelgroup. We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of otherCabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before wewere schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company herein Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest andseizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other MilitaryPersonnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late PresidentLaurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner whocan assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under DiplomaticCover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems fromour lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who workedwith the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that withyour sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within twoweeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of thisfund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful inorder not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund outof Congo, you can contact me through my email addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personalinformation to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone'sSecurity is Guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal assoon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise theutmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.Thank you and God Bless. Best Regards COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.comN\B.

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire (fwd)[Destined to be a new reality TV Show?]Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police IreSat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ETWASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online "anarchist scavengerhunt" proposed for next week's annual meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) andWorld Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ireof police, who fear demonstrators could damageproperty and wreak havoc.Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture aWashington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporateexecutive or World Bank delegate.D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told acongressional hearing on Friday that law authoritieswere in talks to decide whether planned protests were,"so deleterious to security efforts that we ought totake proactive action."Several thousand people are expected to demonstrateoutside the IMF and World Bank headquarters nextweekend.The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-basedanarchist group, is also planning a day-long trafficblockade, banner-drops and protests against majorcorporations in the downtown core.Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist sitewww.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke."People were asking for things to do when they come toD.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so theydon't do the boring, standard stuff," he said. "Idoubt people will actually keep track of what they dofor points."	0

[zzzzteana] Nobel astrophysicistsNobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PMSTOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize inphysics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves innature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneeringcontributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmicX-ray sources.''Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the otherhalf of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of theUniversity of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giantunderground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream fromthe sun by the billion.Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings becausethey are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a SouthDakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrinodetector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, andalso discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some ofthe brightest objects in the universe.The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize forbuilding the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - andsharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to thediscovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into thehearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outsideWashington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshibaalso was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reachDavis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons SydneyBrenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at theKarolinska Institute.The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organgrowth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on howviruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such asAIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesdaymorning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory ofAlfred Nobel later the same day.The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the SwedishAcademy said on Tuesday.The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates arenot publicly revealed for 50 years.Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite whoendowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given tothose who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the fieldof physics.''The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry andeconomics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and expertsin the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conductedin strict secrecy.The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.---On the Net:Nobel site, http://www.nobel.se ------------------------ Yahoo!

Re: EBusiness Webforms: cluetrain has left the stationI'll agree that webforms are a pain in the ass, however it would seem to me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the autoform function, providing more info than you want to.  That and some entity would be holding the passport info, thus have all that data in the first place.Personally i'd never trust them not to at least use it internally to market to me, if not sell/rent out.  Just think of the ability they'd have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was tracked to you.  And thats just the marketing side of it.ChrisOn Sat, 28 Sep 2002, Gregory Alan Bolcer wrote:> What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.

Re: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...)Definitional nit to pick:Robert Harley writes:> It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,> precisely identical between males and females.> > Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.You've redefined "promiscuity" above as "total" or "average" activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: activity above some specific threshold (usually "one") or norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. "Promiscuity" is thus inherently a description of distributions rather than averages.Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Letthere be three pairings which result in each personhaving sex once. Then, let one of the males also have sex with the other two females. Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partnersis equal between the sexes, tautologically. But here more women than men are: - above the single partner threshold - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners - above the overall mode 1 acts/partnersAnd here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) number of partners.So in this contrived population, females are more "promiscuous" than males, unless "promiscuity" is defined uselessly.- Gordon	0

This is a good thing.  Getting hammered for stupid investments is likelyto result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed towin all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. "A fool and his money are soon parted" and all that.  It isn't the jobof the FTC/SEC/IRS/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and Ihave grave doubts that they could even if it was their job). > They > finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off > hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not acrime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is aGovernment Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds. > So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?Perhaps it is just a matter of personal preference, but I'd rather notlive in a "feed lot" society, thank-you-very-much.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com	0

[ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount.Hi -( http://club.4tfox.com )You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.And they expect you to listen to them?Enough.If you want to make money with your computer, then you shouldhook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are makinga large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we willshow YOU how to do the same thing.This business is done completely by internet and email, and youcan even join for free to check it out first.  If you can sendan email, you can do this.  No special "skills" are required.How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But ifyou are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might bejust the thing you are looking for.This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that isdone FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increaseeach month also).Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as afree member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if youdecide it is not for you.

As youshould know, but evidently don't, poll() isn't even "a bit better" ---in fact, it's about an order of magnitude worse --- for dense filedescriptor sets, which is the normal case.

After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally  catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for  nontrivial apps? No way!The point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't tryto tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don'tcare --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unixhasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since youwere in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't"totally suck for nontrivial apps".For what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* callsfor a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers ofconcurrent I/O requests.  I find references to the glibcimplementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I couldprobably find much earlier references if I had time:http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html(more details athttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/docs/io-events.html;details on the SGI patch are athttp://oss.sgi.com/projects/kaio/faq.html)> > Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations> > have supported multithreading for a decade or more.> > And most UNIX is still kinda-sorta supporting the pthreads (POSIX)> interface, each in their own 7/8 implementation. You're safe if you> stick to the basics.Your original complaint was that Unix didn't do multithreading ormultiprogramming well.  Now that I've pointed out how obviouslyidiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, althoughindividual Unixes do these things well, you complain that theirimplementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threadsspecification.  Well, that's probably true, but I haven't writtenpthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my ownexperience.  But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason toprefer Windows.I'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threadingimplementations.  Spare us.

Colonial Script ...Oh, they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over theAmerican Colonies.  And, BTW, England as well.Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons.  First of all thecolonies were not prosperous compared to England proper.  Second, theissuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim.  Itsounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments waseconomically crippling.  Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offeringIOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paperas the merchant who took the IOU.===========================The most common problem in the world is when a government prints toomuch money.  The effects are a complete disaster.  There are a lot ofincentives that push governments into doing this even though it isincredibly stupid.So almost all the literature talks about that.But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out ofcirculation.  The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression wasexactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canadahad much effect.

RE: OSCOM Berkeley report: Xopus, Bitflux, Plone, XoopsI attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems thatJim didn't mention. In terms of CMS, the following all had apparentlybeen used in some fairly large implementations and looked like somepretty strong competition to commercial systems:- Midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a PHP-based contentmanagement framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS- Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: http://www.spamassassin.taint.org/software/ccm/cms/- OpenCMS, Java-based: http://www.opencms.orgThere was agreement that usability has not generally been an open sourcestrength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movementtowards improving that situation.I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took forgranted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took itjust as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignoreXML almost completely. I attended realizing that "content management" is generally used toapply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked howcompletely out of scope document management was (almost no considerationof the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than theoccasional "...and you can use FOP to make PDF" as if that wasfunctional): this seems more the case in open source content managementthan in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier toignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).The honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state ofcurrent tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I'd writtendown what he said, something like "it sucks so extremely, it sucks sowidely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there isno hope." For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercialsystems scaled so well that the commercial "big boys" were really muchmore functional than open source, until someone pointed out, "OK, takesome average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it'll scalepretty well." Another quote (citing Brendan Quinn): "content managementproblems are either trivial or impossible."Mac OS X is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3each of Mac, Linux, Windows.I am sure it wasn't news to Jim, but I can't wait to try Subversion, aCVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV:http://subversion.tigris.org/I'm also eager to try Xopus, I hope the developers make it back homesafely, they said they'd only been in America four days but were alreadyhomeless...Max	0

[zzzzteana] Big cats 'on the increase'http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stmBig cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards recordnumbers, a monitoring group has claimed. The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports ofanimals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigersover the past 12 months. And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than theaverage moggy, it claims to have "firm evidence" that the majority are real.Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with thecritics and doubters, adding: "I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the samerealm as the Loch Ness monster. "But it's not, they are really out there." 'Cats with cubs' Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of thecountry. Big cat reports  Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  "This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire," he said. The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist insufficient numbers to breed among themselves. "We have had sightings of cats with cubs," he added. 'Trigger camera' The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, includingphotographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical publicthat it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. A national "trigger camera" project is planned which, the society hopes,will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. Mr Bamping said: "The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera andtake a picture of itself." 'Like dogs' The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into thewild, or their descendants. Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: "In the 1960s and 1970s, people had bigcats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. "But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, peoplereleased their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put themdown, or take them to a zoo."------------------------ Yahoo!

Re: EntrepreneursOn Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 10:58:34PM +0200, Robert Harley wrote:> An apparent quote from Dubya, from the Times (sent to me by my Dad):> > http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-43-351083,00.htmlhttp://www.snopes.com/quotes/bush.htmClaim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, "The problem withthe French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur."Origins:   Yet another French fried "George W. Bush is dumb"story has been taken up by those who like their caricaturesdrawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt thatemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's PresidentJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,the decline of the French economy. "The problem with theFrench," Bush afterwards confided in Blair, "is that they don'thave a word for entrepreneur."The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the BaronessWilliams of Crosby, who claimed "my good friend Tony Blair" hadrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach BaronessWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he didreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director ofcommunications and strategy. "I can tell you that the primeminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainlynever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,"Campbell told The Post. "If she put this in a speech, it musthave been a joke."This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt ofa jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less thanstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memoriestoo hard, we can come up with three other instances we'vechronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of themoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in theranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being peggedas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of theintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamusquatrain which pontificated that the "village idiot" would winthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, itwas the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folksto chortling up their sleeves.Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectualshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because theyseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about thispublic figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's everbeen. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer atsome level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will alwaysfall upon appreciative ears.Barbara "ears of corn" MikkelsonLast updated:   29 July 2002http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork	0

Re: The Curse of India's SocialismI think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own "Permit Rajs" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?-Ian.On Tuesday, August 20, 2002, at 12:09 PM, John Hall wrote:> The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails> Everywhere Else -- by Hernando De Soto>> Is something I'm reading now.>> My impression is that France is not anywhere near the "Permit Raj"> nightmare that India is (and became).

Jody and I live in Chicago.<BR>I am an accountant with a major US Corporation and I make<BR>pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled<BR>to Jody about receiving "junk mail".  I made fun of the<BR>whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work.  Jody<BR>totally ignored my supposed intelligence and a few days later<BR>she jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her,<BR>and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when<BR>the thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within<BR>3 weeks she had received 50 responses.  Within the next 45<BR>days she had received a total of $147,200.00 all cash!<BR>I was shocked.  I have joined Jody in her "hobby".<BR><BR>     Mitchell Wof,  Chicago, Illinois<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to<BR>make up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative<BR>that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little<BR>that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders<BR>to at least get my money back.  I was surprised when I found<BR>my medium sized post office box crammed with orders.  I made<BR>$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this<BR>deal is that it does not matter where people live.  There<BR>simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and<BR>so big".<BR><BR>     Dan Sondstrom,  Alberta, Canada<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later<BR>I wondered if I should hav given it a try.  Of course, I<BR>had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to<BR>wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else . . . . . . . <BR>11 months passed then it luckily came again.  I did not <BR>delete this one!  I made more than $490,000 on my first try<BR>and all the money came within 22 weeks".<BR><BR>     Susan De Suza,   New York, NY<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy<BR>money

Never pay eBay listing fees again!Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people makingwhopping huge money online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, orboy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the realmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999, small-timeentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?You might not want their product, but remember that thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a fewdollars to over a hundred dollars just to post oneauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe acouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousandover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CANSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAYat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees whenhardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF ATHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in New York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the "Dot Com" mania, and I've never looked back.  I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experiencewhatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like thatyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answerYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that youwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could bemaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  Thisis no "get rich quick scheme".  You have to workto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step how to start your first email campaign and how tobuild a booming online business.  You'll be generating orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hotproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delaystarting an Internet business because they have nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own bulk email campaign less than a week after reading the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; where else will you find that level of service?!I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting your very first email campaign called "Seven Days to Bulk Email Success".  This seperate guide contains a daily routine for you to follow with specific, exact instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your very first campaign is ready to go.As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk email program which retails for $49.99!

Still looking for a house?My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.I need those houses...Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use "unconventional" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com Best Wishes, Jeremy Lessaris847.366.4300www.synteligent.comjeremy@synteligent.comTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.orgwith "unsubscribe freebsd-ports" in the body of the message	1

For consultancy, integration or open source work, sure, perl, python orjava with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense IMO.I should note that normally when I've used C or C++ in the past, it'sdictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product,written from the ground up, where the code you're generating is importantIP for the company; in this case, using a third-party lib often is not anoption, or would be a PITA licensing-wise.Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of "oops,there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shoparound for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it's got,rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best".This can be a *very* big deal, for obvious reasons ;)    Open sourceknockers should note that this is not a problem when using LGPL'd libs ;)--j.	0

What the heck."Believe me, no matter where you believe those "feelings"come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would bedoing had I not.

Due to the popularity of this letter onthe internet, a national weekly news program recentlydevoted an entire show to the investigation of thisprogram described below, to see if it really can makepeople money. The show also investigated whether ornot the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation inthe program and if people can 'follow the simpleinstructions' they are bound to make some mega buckswith only $25 out of pocket cost".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECTTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKINGBETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: "Thanks to thisprofitable opportunity. I was approached many timesbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expectin return for the minimal effort and money required.To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.==================================================Another said: "This program has been around for along time but I never believed in it.

After you have ordered all 5 reports, take thisadvertisement and REMOVE the name & address of theperson in REPORT # 5. This person has made it throughthe cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 26....

This is critical to YOUR success.==================================================**** Take this entire letter, with the modifiedlist of names, and save it on your computer.DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you loseany data. To assist you with marketing your businesson the internet, the 5 reports you purchase willprovide you with invaluable marketing informationwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get thisventure going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to seehow it goes, and we will assume you and those involvedsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)response (the response could be much better but let'sjust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people respondedby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders. That's 100 people whoresponded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each fora total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER ANDFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NOMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILLMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to thinkfor a moment what would happen if everyone or halfor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internetworldwide and counting, with thousands more comingonline every day. Believe me, many people will dojust that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive andthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.Placing a lot of free ads on the internet willeasily get a larger response. We strongly suggestyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as yougo along. For every $5 you receive, all you mustdo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,with your name and address on it, will be promptbecause they cannot advertise until they receivethe report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the "cash" is not because this isillegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared orapproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no onecan SEE there is money in the envelope and stealit before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) foreach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure thecash is concealed by wrapping it in at least2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets ofpaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the reportyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and yourname and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :==================================================REPORT # 1: "The Insider's Guide To Advertisingfor Free On The Net"Order Report #1 from:Robert Borowczykul.

My wife, Jody and I live inChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the populationand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I mademerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she hadreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days shehad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois================================================"Not being the gambling type, it took me severalweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.But conservative as I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no waythat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back. I was surprised when I found mymedium size post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does notmatter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big."Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada================================================="I had received this program before. I deleted it,but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailedagain by someone else......... 11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all themoney came within 22 weeks."Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.================================================="It really is a great opportunity to make relativelyeasy money with little cost to you. I followed thesimple instructions carefully and within 10 days themoney started to come in.

[zzzzteana] Playboy wants to go out with a bangThe Scotsman - 22 August 2002 Playboy wants to go out with a bang    AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000 (£160,000).   Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners, said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive young woman - preferably under 30.   "I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with me gets all the money," Mr Eden told Bild newspaper.   "I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all end with a heart attack and then Im gone."   Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be sent in quickly because of his age. "It could end very soon," he said.------------------------ Yahoo!

FEMI DANIELFEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSINGFEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEXIKOYI-LAGOS.ATTN:,                  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me.

Things have got much better... You're right in that the JDK used tosuck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at leastdevelopment tools for Linux are maturing... I've been developing a fewserver side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they've hadno problems with great performance.Robert Harley worte:>Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.>They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a>service pack.

You don't think this hasanything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you?  Or that MS hasbasically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#?Isn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is theright way to go for most high level applications?Reza B'Far wrote:>2.

So you're telling me that unless the application involvesbit-counting, it's trivial?  What about the application itself?  What abouthigh level problems such as task distribution, work-flow, etc.?  Aren't mosthigh level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns?Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C/C++ code?

However, what I believe to really be thecase is that Java is one of the best languages for writing largeapplications with many components that involves the collaboration of morethan three programmers.  In those cases, it's always very hard to get theprogrammers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc.  WithJava, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around ina long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database(JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS).>3.

(aside to the minimal ANSI stuff).  Is there a standard way ofdealing with C/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging,database persistence, etc.) that rivals Java?  I'd like to know if there isone accepted by everyone who writes C/C++... In that case, I claimignorance...Not suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C/C++ isoverkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgraceto programming... It's just lame... Java is Object Oriented... (noflame-mail from the anti-OO people please... that is a religiousdiscussion...) and relatively clean... And I don't think that every "Kid"can write a well designed Java program.  Kids typically don't understandvarious design patterns and principles... To my experience, they actuallytend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite andreinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, IMHO, in C/C++than in Java due to existence of standard API's.	0

Special Affiliate Offers from Amazon.Com!                   Welcome to "Ghetto" America!...Yes, you heard me; I said "Ghetto" America! What is "Ghetto" America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is no less true! "Ghetto" America is a society of individuals comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the impoverished, and often unpolished side of "Black America;" Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a typical ghetto community; namely the "projects" and noticed an unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young "teen looking" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the absence of the all important "wedding band" missing from their respective ring fingers!" .And of course we have all heard stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know that many young African American women refuse to date African American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as "Thugs" or "Street Hustlers;" Also, did you know that many young African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while living in government housing better known as the "projects" rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make investments?     "Attention" This is Not another "Boyz in the Hood" Story! These newly distinguished "Black Generation Xers" are suffering through utter chaos. "Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare Abusers...Images of My America" is a collection of observations, and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths that many in "Black America," and the world in general would have you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of "Mainstream American Society." A society that has nurtured the rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The writer supports his arguments with direct references to the overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or cool neighborhood reputation. The author also identifies the self-destructive and often criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack of direction that currently exists in young "Black America" today.

This money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled aspersonal belongings and as such the security company does not know the true content of the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used for his political campaign. Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit before he died of cardiac arrest.As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with an offshore Security Company to move this money as a consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore affiliated office where you will be required to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund. If you are interested to carry out this transaction with me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general expenses, and 75% for us.You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction also which will be used to effect the change of ownership of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the consignment.Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy communication Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 (seven) working days.I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com Best regards, Barrister Williams Falana {SAN} _________________________________________________________ Envoyez des messages musicaux sur le portable de vos amis  http://mobile.lycos.fr/mobile/local/sms_musicaux/	1

[ILUG] MICHAEL ! ilug ilug , From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,          Johannesburg,South Africa.My Dear ,Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's! regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.Best Regards, Mr.Michael Kamah and family.   -- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	1

The Next World Orderhttp://newyorker.com/fact/content/?020401fa_FACT1The New YorkerTHE NEXT WORLD ORDERby NICHOLAS LEMANNThe Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.Issue of 2002-04-01Posted 2002-03-25When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new peopleoften persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyonesuspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the BushAdministration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by afather-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believethat, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family hasresumed its governance-and about time, too.The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, orworse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense andforeign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of asClinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article inForeign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clintonof "an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of thecommander in chief." Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in thisAdministration also served under the President's father. They took officelast year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswattingby Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administrationforeign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the OvalRoom. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whosecover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of theworld, and these words:Defense Strategy for the 1990s:The Regional Defense StrategySecretary of DefenseDick CheneyJanuary 1993One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government iscommunicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even electedpoliticians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then performpublicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defenseare just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is goto meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, toexplain that some of the documents, including the report that the seniorofficial handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from ahigh-school term paper, represent the government version of playingCarnegie Hall?After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary ofDefense, set up a "shop," as they say, to think about American foreignpolicy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whoseexistence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, ata higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary ofDefense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a seniorforeign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group ofconservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, andintellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (DonaldRumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and hasbeen closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) ColinPowell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted acompeting, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagineAmerican foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on whicheach team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief PresidentBush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling thenew grand strategy.Everybody worked for months on the "five-twenty-one brief," with a sensethat the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz andPowell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, buthis briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn'tget to present his alternate version of the future of the United States inthe world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his majorforeign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day thatIraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of thematerial, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagonenvisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, preventany other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks ofcontroversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being"unilateral"-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denialsand the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheneyteam's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that thesenior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days beforeClinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a "scrubbed,"meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained theessential ideas of "shaping," rather than reacting to, the rest of theworld, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one ofskepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of thesame ideas can be found in a short book titled "From Containment to GlobalLeadership?," which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 andis now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into theClinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends thatthe United States "preclude the rise of another global rival for theindefinite future." Khalilzad writes, "It is a vital U.S. interest topreclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessaryfor the purpose."When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people aroundhim didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines ofthe policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence whichthe United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first majorforeign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that "aPresident must be a clear-eyed realist," a formulation that seems toconnote an absence of world-remaking ambition. "Realism" is exactly theforeign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partlybecause it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominatingworld affairs for any length of time.One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terroristattacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bushhas done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domesticsecurity. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are trulyentering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are thatBush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change indirection rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congresssince September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind whichhis aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment ofdestiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertivepolicymaking.Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been "atransformative moment," as the senior official I had lunch with put it, isnot so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officialshad previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the Americanpublic's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, atleast for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the "BlackHawk Down" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on theconviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombingKosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreignmilitary adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, theoptions are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,which argued that the "mass public" is much less casualty-averse than themilitary or the civilian élite believes; for example, the study showed thatthe public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation toprevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The Americandeath total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice'sForeign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: "The UnitedStates has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'in the absence of Soviet power." I asked her whether that is still thecase. "I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role," she saidimmediately. "I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakesthat clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief." Like Bush,she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weaponsof mass destruction "in the hands of irresponsible states" now define thenational interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech toCongress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was endingterrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face thepart of the White House grounds where television reporters do theirstandups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she doesin public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind ofmissionary calm, rather than belligerence.In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,putting forth "the notions of power politics, great powers, and powerbalances" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now shesounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney'sPentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that theother great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because ofthe terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. "Theoretically, therealists would predict that when you have a great power like the UnitedStates it would not be long before you had other great powers rising tochallenge it or trying to balance against it," Rice said. "And I think whatyou're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move toproductive and coöperative relations with the United States, rather than totry to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft mattersin how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained."Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of theNational Security Council and asked them to think seriously about "how doyou capitalize on these opportunities" to fundamentally change Americandoctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. "Ireally think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947," she said-that is,the period when the containment doctrine took shape-"in that the events soclearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a bigglobal threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normallythought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting thetectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try toseize on that and position American interests and institutions and all ofthat before they harden again."The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annualdocument called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goalsof American policy-another government report whose importance is great butnot obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as theClinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she isworking on the report now."There are two ways to handle this document," she told me. "One is to do itin a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it'simportant. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, priorto 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but Iwould think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a realstatement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic directionthat it's going."It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominantAmerican role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Somequestions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously beingasked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone inforeign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engenderinside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak acouple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensivecapability against "rogue states," departed from decades of officialadherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication ofthe scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States nowin a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the BushAdministration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly itis, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a fewmonths ago.Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggestedto me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction inforeign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz orRichard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, hepublished a book titled "The Reluctant Sheriff," in which he poked a littlefun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (hecalled it the "Pentagon Paper") and disagreed with its idea that the UnitedStates should try to be the world's only great power over the long term."For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach," Haass wrote. "Itsimply is not doable." Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another ofthe Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the"democratic zone of peace": "Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic." Haassargued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, notmore, and suggested "a revival of what might be called traditionalgreat-power politics."Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary ofDefense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in hisoffice at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was anarray of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine andthe first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington thatHaass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book."Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreignpolicy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard caseto make," he said. "It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's theeconomy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are verydifferent now. One, the President has a much easier time making the casethat foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-securitycharts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism."I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad asKennan's containment. "I think there is," he said. "What you're seeing fromthis Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body ofideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call thelimits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not tomassacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some ofthe normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left aloneinside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even leadto a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially canact in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,and not if, you're going to be attacked."Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. "I don't think the American publicneeds a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein," he said."Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make thecase. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case thatthis isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense."On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was stillmaintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not longbefore called "Imperial America," but he told me that there is a bigdifference between imperial and imperialist. "I just think that we have tobe a little bit careful," he said. "Great as our advantages are, there arestill limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas oneveryone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others tojoin us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It hasto be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can'tsend forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor."He stopped for a moment. "Is there a successor idea to containment? I thinkthere is," he said. "It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on tocertain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition toterrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policiesand then building institutions that lock them in even more."The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a newAmerican foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. Whatthe United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what'sbeen done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of theoperation itself and in terms of its aftermath.Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage ofhis aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public eventwas a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi'sleading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and formerDefense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremelyconfident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, "Evidence is mountingthat the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealingwith Saddam Hussein." The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete"until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing hisregime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt."Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with atwinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suitand a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and hissupporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient Americansupport, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated theTaliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people inWashington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebelmilitary leader ("He could fight you for the last petit four on the trayover tea at the Savoy, but that's about it," one skeptical former Pentagonofficial told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam'smilitary is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has beenquite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The UnitedStates left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to aninternal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weakernow, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing couldfinish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the ideathat a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment ofanywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American groundtroops.Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National SecurityCouncil's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the ClintonAdministration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world bypublishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authorspublished an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the IraqiNational Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn'tthink Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require asubstantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the onewe used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now inAfghanistan.Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given abriefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office inWashington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk andwalked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East werehanging. "The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion," he said, using apen as a pointer. "We're talking about two grand corps, two to threehundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in theTigris-Euphrates valley." He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra."Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board." He pointed to the Prince Sultanairbase, near Riyadh. "You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easierin Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq"-pointingagain-"because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oilfields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oilfields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend theKurds in northern Iraq." Point, point. "You go in as hard as you can, asfast as you can." He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. "You get theenemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once." Hishand hit the desk again, hard. "Then you crush him." Smack.That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removedthe government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviouslyshaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,which before September 11th clearly met the new test of nationalunacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of massdestruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country isnot wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of DanielPearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligenceservice, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must beestablished-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is noobvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawnstrong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is anuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internalaffairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, SaudiArabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to becomedirectly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wantedto do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the waythat Europe was immediately after the Second World War.In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediatemoves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is anindication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration'sconservatives. "These guys are relentless," one former official, who isclose to the high command at the State Department, told me. "Resistance isfutile." The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, isintellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and sinceSeptember 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at leastthe beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptancepractically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies thedoctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, "shaping" and expanding "the zoneof democracy," the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility withthe Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whomsee the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewiswas invited to the White House in December to brief the seniorforeign-policy staff. "One point he made is, Look, in that part of theworld, nothing matters more than resolute will and force," the seniorofficial I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn'tproceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the "Arab street," as long as it isprepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interestingthinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essaydeclared, "Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,"and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who publishedan article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime inIran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could beaccomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of thenations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going tofinish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatictour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamelyabsorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, theAdministration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance ofthe world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that theUnited States should assemble "coalitions of the willing" to support itsactions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructureof international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would testthat policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting thatit can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publiclyopposed the Iraq operation.When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it askedfor a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improvemilitary pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated asan unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war onterrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion ofIraq.This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries aboutthe invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bushbuilds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about theunacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A dramainvolving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the springand summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the termsthat Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, theenormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. TheAdministration obviously feels confident that the United States caneffectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troopbuildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause theRepublican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddamand topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to afull-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently willbegin soon.Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney'sfuture-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, nowworks in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking theWest Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet ofpublic-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication ofhis 1996 novel, "The Apprentice," quotes the Times' calling him "DickCheney's Dick Cheney," which seems like an apt description: he appearsabsolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result ofthe influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravellyrumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression ofhaving calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstructionwhich the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting forthose charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the onlytruly prudent course.When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, beforeSeptember 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have beendifferent. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the MiddleEast. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer."Let us stack it up," he said at last. "Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discoveryof the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World TradeCenter, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of aserious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobarbombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassybombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing ofthe Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and thefailure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take thatlong list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged peoplefrom supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against ourinterests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouragedfurther aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to riseup and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defendthemselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They aremorally weak.' "Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not beenstandard or foreordained. "Look at what the President has done inAfghanistan," he said, "and look at his speech to the joint session ofCongress"-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. "He made itclear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe inexpanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. Andhe had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and tobegin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there isnot a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He couldhave waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engagedin long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a newrelationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been soafraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list couldgo on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations whilestanding up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't knowyet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations notonly with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with thestates of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with thestates of Southwest Asia more generally."We moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Husseinunacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. "The issue is not inspections,"Libby said. "The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of massdestruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, theirpromise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they madein '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problemsI listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraqwas given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed totake that chance then, and annually for the next ten years.""What's your level of confidence," I asked him, "that the current regimewill, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?"He ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spokeslowly and deliberately. "There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to haveconfidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior."-- -----------------R. A.

[vox] Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire (fwd)Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police IreSat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ETWASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online "anarchist scavengerhunt" proposed for next week's annual meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) andWorld Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ireof police, who fear demonstrators could damageproperty and wreak havoc.Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture aWashington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporateexecutive or World Bank delegate.D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told acongressional hearing on Friday that law authoritieswere in talks to decide whether planned protests were,"so deleterious to security efforts that we ought totake proactive action."Several thousand people are expected to demonstrateoutside the IMF and World Bank headquarters nextweekend.The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-basedanarchist group, is also planning a day-long trafficblockade, banner-drops and protests against majorcorporations in the downtown core.Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist sitewww.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke."People were asking for things to do when they come toD.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so theydon't do the boring, standard stuff," he said. "Idoubt people will actually keep track of what they dofor points."	0

However, the additional information won't be required.The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous political spam.Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade groups.FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the potential to reach more voters."We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before everyone understands how the technology is going to work," he said.Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political messages while remaining anonymous.Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as "good for America.""It will allow people to receive more communication from those running for office," he said.

Sun Nabs Storage Startup - buys Pirus NetworksRelated to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?==http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271Sun Nabs Storage StartupBy Clint BoultonAmid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in SanFrancisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase datastorage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startupwith a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices andvirtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devicesinto what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device thatis managed from a central console.Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likesof Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus afterscouting some 65 companies.Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.comthat Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possibleacquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot ofstorage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, suchas Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi."This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7or 8 system-level players," Lovington said. "Sun sees this acquisition as acritical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious."N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have arole in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styledas the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers andnetworks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining groundin the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president ofIDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largestincreases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of$411 million.Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter ofSun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.	0

All the usual         fun from the creators of the Scrambling for Safety crypto         cons: we confidently predict government spokesmen caught in         headlights, wanton Dave Bird heckling, some industry bigwig         fighting off the audience with a broken chairleg, and other         epiphenomena of the interzone between legal minds and hacker         ethics. Oh, and FIPR are still looking for a Programme         Director, so if you're interested, let them know. We         suggested a convention raffle (first prize: the director's         job, second prize: Ross Anderson as your personal slave for         a day). They say there's some rule that would break, though.         http://www.fipr.org/vacancy.html- doesn't the Foundation use psychohistory for filling these positions?         For those of us who can't read the abbreviation EULA without          thinking of Martian fighting machines and their "deafening          howls... which roared like thunder", we're sorry to report          that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR          OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to "health and safety          issues". The event was to feature computer graphics,          fireworks, "60ft-tall Martian fighting machines" wreaking          "havoc and destruction", and - most terrifyingly of all - the          possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with          Hawkwind, but UKP18 tickets for the Sat 2002-08-31 show at          Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new          venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original          invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety          issues, "slain after all man's devices had failed by the          humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this          earth: bacteria.

Added a second harddiskfor Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, whichwentfine except it didn't pick up my monitor.I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidiaGeForce4Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse'sdefaultset. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it usingRPM.Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),butit still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Locktwice,the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switchisinactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?Opinionswelcome.Thanks a lot,Peter--Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	0

But why, oh, why, keep that shaved-headphoto on prominent display???  There are lots of photos of Rohitlooking rather dashing, and with the crucial hair feature enabled!R	0

SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS.         Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika.          Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?_______________________________________________________________________Powered by List BuilderTo unsubscribe follow the link:http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4	1

wifi progressWell it looks pretty much 99% sure that we will be moving in on Nov 1 tothe new house. I think the only thing that stops us now are acts ofdieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for thenext few weeks..In preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test corefor the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wirelessap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptopI made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up thecard, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire etherhub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via thewebinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features somemore (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)but all in all a smooth move.Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots offunky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions getgoofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet betweenthe AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting11mbs and at least 60% goodness.Some cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal worksinthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have amicrowave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bearcat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a badthing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then Ihope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )Ok, enough testing for tonight.

Jody and I live in Chicago.<BR>I am an accountant with a major US Corporation and I make<BR>pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled<BR>to Jody about receiving "junk mail".  I made fun of the<BR>whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work.  Jody<BR>totally ignored my supposed intelligence and a few days later<BR>she jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her,<BR>and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when<BR>the thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within<BR>3 weeks she had received 50 responses.  Within the next 45<BR>days she had received a total of $147,200.00 all cash!<BR>I was shocked.  I have joined Jody in her "hobby".<BR><BR>     Mitchell Wof,  Chicago, Illinois<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to<BR>make up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative<BR>that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little<BR>that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders<BR>to at least get my money back.  I was surprised when I found<BR>my medium sized post office box crammed with orders.  I made<BR>$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this<BR>deal is that it does not matter where people live.  There<BR>simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and<BR>so big".<BR><BR>     Dan Sondstrom,  Alberta, Canada<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later<BR>I wondered if I should hav given it a try.  Of course, I<BR>had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to<BR>wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else . . . . . . . <BR>11 months passed then it luckily came again.  I did not <BR>delete this one!  I made more than $490,000 on my first try<BR>and all the money came within 22 weeks".<BR><BR>     Susan De Suza,   New York, NY<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy<BR>money

UCI Creative WritingMore articles that support my fantasy that Irvine is thecenter of the universe.  We've got the corner on electriccars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics,outside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers.UCI's creative writing department has been in the news a lot over the course of the last decade.  Somequotes from the article[1]:   "In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop    'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's    exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring    and uncannily timely novel. The novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's "TheLovely Bones" which is on the way to the top of the NY Times best-sellers list.  My uncle used to tease meabout UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobodyknew who UC Irvine was just two states over.  In fact,I used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UCschools, and when I went off to college in 1985, myrelatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. I took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's faculty called "the art of writing fiction".   If therewas ever any two classes that helped contributed to writingmy dissertation, it was that one which taught me how toget the writing flowing and my high school typing classwhich taught me how to type really fast.  One of the advantages they cite in the article is that theyseem to take a chance on the "not-so-sure" bet, but accordingto the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone onto write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industryis creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent whichcreates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out moresuccess stories which lures more talent.

Patch to enable/disable logWhile I was playing with the past issues, it annoyed me that there wasno easy way to make the log stop growing (I don't mean to truncate it,I mean to just freeze it for a while).The following patch adds a new button to the log window, which allowsthe log to be switched on/off (the button says "Disable" when thelog is enabled, and the button disables it, and "Enable" when the logis frozen, and the button enables it again).kre--- main.tclWed Aug 21 15:01:48 2002+++ /usr/local/lib/exmh-2.5/main.tclWed Aug 28 17:36:59 2002@@ -385,6 +385,9 @@ ExmhLogCreate wm withdraw $exmh(logTop)     }+    if {! $exmh(logWrite)} {+return+    }     if [info exists exmh(log)] { catch { #    $exmh(log) insert end " [bw_delta] "@@ -407,6 +410,9 @@     set exmh(logWindow) 1     Exwin_Toplevel .log "Exmh Log" Log     set exmh(logTop) .log+    set exmh(logDisableBut) \+[Widget_AddBut $exmh(logTop).but swap "Disable" ExmhLogToggle]+    set exmh(logWrite) 1     Widget_AddBut $exmh(logTop).but trunc "Truncate" ExmhLogTrunc     Widget_AddBut $exmh(logTop).but save "Save To File" ExmhLogSave     set exmh(logYview) 1@@ -457,6 +463,12 @@     } msg] { Exmh_Status "Cannot save log: $msg" error     }+}+proc ExmhLogToggle {} {+    global exmh++    set exmh(logWrite) [expr ! $exmh(logWrite)]+    $exmh(logDisableBut) configure -text [lindex {"Enable " Disable} $exmh(logWrite)] } #### Misc _______________________________________________Exmh-workers mailing listExmh-workers@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers	0

[ILUG] Marketing SIG has a good start :)         |::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|                IT's Monday 520      02 September 2002              |::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|STUDENT LIFE BEGINS WITH LINUXbyJohn SterneThe launch last month of a marketing special interest group by theIrish Linux Users Group (ILUG)  -  open source and marketing, itseems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts  -  has alreadysparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork.  Whenthe new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student willbe offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran atraining class for staff at the UCC computer science department.Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that theLinux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irishuniversities.The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programmethat aims to introduce students at all levels to the open sourcestyle of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educationalchannel' to reach this audience, bundling educational softwarewith its operating environment and offering networked supportservices to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designedto suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available toschools and universities throughout the world.Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenancefeatures and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard tomaster on personal systems.The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of RedHat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financialservices for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until nowits involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices inEurope that offer consulting or technical support services.David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to takea more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, hisoffice in Cork has received more and more calls from Irishcompanies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introducedsome to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.-------------Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.RegardsL.-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	0
[ILUG] connecting at 1200bps in RH7.3 (help!)Hi All,Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56KFaxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have toconnect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote serveras it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windowsworked first time(!?), any ideas?Baud 1200 7 data bits Even ParityI am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1... which is most of the defaults.USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) & set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just givingup.btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring theirmodems may be difficult.Colin.-- Colin Nevin,Software Engineer,Merit Solutions Ltd.

SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS.         Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika.          Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?_______________________________________________________________________Powered by List BuilderTo unsubscribe follow the link:http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=54EE057E0B6864FB&m=5	1

Senate Committee Passes Nanotech BillWeird... I never thought the govmint would get into funding this. You know'weapons of mass destruction'. etc. etc.==http://dc.internet.com/news/article.php/10849_1467121September 20, 2002Senate Committee Passes Nanotech BillBy Roy MarkThe Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation topromote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. RonWyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Actwould create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill isco-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that wouldsupport long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effectiveeducation and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchersand professionals."The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big stepforward for this very small technology," Lieberman, who vowed to pushed tofull Senate passage before the end of the year, said. "Nowhere in the worldare the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm ofnanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent tolead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will providethe nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitatenew collaborations between government, academia, and industry that willensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation."The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnologyprogram under the National Science and Technology Council. It would alsocreate a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and NationalNanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative andtechnical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council."My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential tochange America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computerrevolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but willmine the opportunities of nanotechnology," Wyden said in introducing thebill. "At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across ahalf-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its variousnanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leaderin this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential toachieving that goal.To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center forSocietal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related toNanotechnology would also be established.According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of theNational Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of theNational Nanotechnology Initiative in June.Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term andshort-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support researchthat falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promotinginterdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technologytransition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societalimplications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics formeasuring progress toward program goals.	0

Partnership.Dear Sir, With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe youwouldbe of great assistance to my children and I.I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believedthatyou must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like tointimidate meor betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in theKEREMAlocal district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.MUNDI A.KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John PaulKoromahbecause he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond MiningCorporationof Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he instructed meand my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)forcesintervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My childrenand Imanaged to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We cameintoTogo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVEMILLIONUNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have depositedwith aTrust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with thecurriercompany who will freight the money to your country.Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment inyourcountry because of a stable political situation there and mostly for thefuture ofmy children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from theTrustCompany in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will bedepositedinto your account for investment in your country. You should also help us tosource for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in yourcountry when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we haveresolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how Iam beingmonitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will adviceyou tohave the deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on thisemail:ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable usproceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferringsame intoyour account.Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for privatediscussions.

High-Altitude Ramboshttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/opinion/23HERB.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=top The New York TimesSeptember 23, 2002High-Altitude RambosBy BOB HERBERTDr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from LakeWorth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month inone of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in theU.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight fromAtlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach sectionbegan behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to dowith Dr. Rajcoomar.Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved backto coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slightman who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuerrefused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were tryingout for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained himin a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quitejittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flightattendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals werenot ready to let things quiet down.One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. Themarshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, andremain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for anyreason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should tryto visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone whodisobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there wereterrorists on the plane."I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurizedcabin," said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court ofCommon Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in anaisle seat in coach. "I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfirein a shootout."Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from herhusband, said, "It was really like Rambo in the air." She worried thatthere might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and thereforedid not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to thebathroom, he or she might be shot.There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. Whenthe plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken intocustody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshalsgrabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason thatanyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station wherehe was thrown into a filthy cell.This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken intocustody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frighteninghours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they wereeventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss theincident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident "tooclosely."If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reportersare headed for jail.Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. "Ihad never been treated like that in my life," he said. "I was afraid that Iwas about to be beaten up or killed."Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case andhe has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawfuldetention."We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security," saidDr. Rajcoomar. "So many men and women have fought and died for freedom inthis great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name ofsecurity."-- -----------------R. A.

InfoWorld profile of Max LevchinCongrats, in the end...> "If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was > susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"http://www.infoworld.com/articles/ct/xml/02/09/02/020902ctspotlight.xmlSecure and at easeBy Jack MccarthyAugust 30, 2002 1:01 pm PTMAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his company for a king's ransom.Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the company."This company was founded on the notion of security value," Levchin says. "Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning."Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good fortune."I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction processor," Levchin says. "We spend a lot of time designing security so it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. The trade-off is fundamental."Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and more than 3 million business accounts.Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. "There are areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore."Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's ability to carry out open communications among the millions of participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says."This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to one another," he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner."If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up," Litan says.To combat criminals, Levchin established "Igor," an antifraud program that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. "The work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has arrived."	0

This is critical to YOUR success.==================================================**** Take this entire letter, with the modifiedlist of names, and save it on your computer.DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you loseany data. To assist you with marketing your businesson the internet, the 5 reports you purchase willprovide you with invaluable marketing informationwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get thisventure going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to seehow it goes, and we will assume you and those involvedsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)response (the response could be much better but let'sjust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people respondedby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders. That's 100 people whoresponded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each fora total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER ANDFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NOMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILLMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to thinkfor a moment what would happen if everyone or halfor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internetworldwide and counting, with thousands more comingonline every day. Believe me, many people will dojust that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive andthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.Placing a lot of free ads on the internet willeasily get a larger response. We strongly suggestyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as yougo along. For every $5 you receive, all you mustdo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,with your name and address on it, will be promptbecause they cannot advertise until they receivethe report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the "cash" is not because this isillegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared orapproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no onecan SEE there is money in the envelope and stealit before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) foreach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure thecash is concealed by wrapping it in at least2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets ofpaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the reportyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and yourname and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :==================================================REPORT # 1: "The Insider's Guide To Advertisingfor Free On The Net"Order Report #1 from:Robert Borowczykul.

My wife, Jody and I live inChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the populationand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I mademerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she hadreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days shehad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois================================================"Not being the gambling type, it took me severalweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.But conservative as I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no waythat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back. I was surprised when I found mymedium size post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does notmatter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big."Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada================================================="I had received this program before. I deleted it,but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailedagain by someone else......... 11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all themoney came within 22 weeks."Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.================================================="It really is a great opportunity to make relativelyeasy money with little cost to you. I followed thesimple instructions carefully and within 10 days themoney started to come in.

Ooops, no wait, scratch that.There is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not beprecisely "free trade/markets" -- when Ben Franklin first visitedEngland he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.  Benexplained that they used "Colonial Script", a kind of barter-dollar,and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  TheBritish bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament toclamp down on the practice.  Within a few years, the colonies wererife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe politicalparty here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint abouttea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they wereprotesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forcesthat killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believesthey were protesting a tea tax.  The same pamphlet claimed that Canadawas also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in thelate-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from thejuristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.I've wondered about all this.  Certainly the timeline of the collapseof the Canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles ofother causes (for example, spending money like we had 300M people whenwe only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this?-- Gary Lawrence Murphy - garym@teledyn.com - TeleDynamics Communications - blog: http://www.auracom.com/~teledyn - biz: http://teledyn.com/ -  "Computers are useless.

QED.My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code bymore than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation ofadditional features that drove us to do the conversion in the firstplace.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in Cthan in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endlesscollection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond thecore libraries of any language that much though.On a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many thingsdue primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a givennon-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function ina pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, butlibraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me evenif they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn'tparticularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a librarythat really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've builta small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the yearsthat I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse whenyou get right down to it.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com	0

RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??right Mike,i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion isonly that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instantshow') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i ammildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected waysonce there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they seeamongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking ontheir phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  justthat it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to familylife to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosionof images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because oftheir utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history ofphotography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changesthings 'big time'.rgds,rob-----Original Message-----From: Mike Masnick [mailto:mike@techdirt.com]Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:58 PMTo: Rob ShavellCc: fork@spamassassin.taint.orgSubject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??Not to keep harping on this, but...At 11:36 PM 8/20/02 -0700, Rob Shavell wrote:>content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful'content>is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users>communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send>half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who>cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.This does nothing to answer my question.  I *do* care about content.  Hell,if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forthall day, I'd have a different opinion of this.  I just am not convincedthat they will (stupid or not).While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the sameargument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know whocommunicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture issuch an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually findyourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?I don't buy it.For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficientmechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say notnearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades andsuch are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way toget a message across.>misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same>thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better>resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - theplant>had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digitalcamera,>and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of>decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the>photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS>didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its>greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS>traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,>SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with "you justdon't understand kids today, and they'll run with this").  I wasn't sayingthat MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn'teasy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a waythat "changed the face of communications".I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) whypeople would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into thephone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly seepeople taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them toother people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this oversending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (oroffline) photoalbum.I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own picsright away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That'sone of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instantview part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want"instant view", but also "instant show".  Which is what this serviceoffers.  I'm not convinced that most people want "instant show".  I thinkpeople like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people puttogether fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them whilethey explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally "instant show" is nice, butit's just "nice" on occasion.  I still can't see how it becomes a integralmessaging method.What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending itfrom one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it'ssilly if people are going to flock to it.I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS latelyare Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news eventwill happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobilephones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story ofwhat happened - before the press even gets there.Willing to be proven wrong,MikePS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly asthey currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork	0

Your eBay account is about to expire!Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people makingwhopping huge money online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, orboy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the realmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999, small-timeentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?You might not want their product, but remember that thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a fewdollars to over a hundred dollars just to post oneauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe acouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousandover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CANSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAYat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees whenhardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF ATHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in New York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the "Dot Com" mania, and I've never looked back.  I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experiencewhatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like thatyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answerYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that youwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could bemaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  Thisis no "get rich quick scheme".  You have to workto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step how to start your first email campaign and how tobuild a booming online business.  You'll be generating orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hotproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delaystarting an Internet business because they have nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own bulk email campaign less than a week after reading the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; where else will you find that level of service?!I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting your very first email campaign called "Seven Days to Bulk Email Success".  This seperate guide contains a daily routine for you to follow with specific, exact instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!

RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks?anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.-h>From: "Rob Shavell" <rob@mobiusvc.com>>To: "'Mike Masnick'" <mike@techdirt.com>>Cc: <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>>Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??>Date: Wed, 21 Aug 2002 01:10:50 -0700>>right Mike,>>i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion is>only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant>show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i am>mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.>>my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways>once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see>amongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on>their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  just>that it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family>life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion>of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of>their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of>photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes>things 'big time'.>>rgds,>rob>>>-----Original Message----->From: Mike Masnick [mailto:mike@techdirt.com]>Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:58 PM>To: Rob Shavell>Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org>Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??>>>Not to keep harping on this, but...>>At 11:36 PM 8/20/02 -0700, Rob Shavell wrote:>>>content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful'>content>>is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users>>communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send>>half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who>>cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.>>This does nothing to answer my question.

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was lodged into a security company here in the Country by the late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled aspersonal belongings and as such the security company does not know the true content of the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used for his political campaign. Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit before he died of cardiac arrest.As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with an offshore Security Company to move this money as a consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore affiliated office where you will be required to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund. If you are interested to carry out this transaction with me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general expenses, and 75% for us.You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction also which will be used to effect the change of ownership of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the consignment.Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy communication Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 (seven) working days.I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com Best regards, Barrister Williams Falana {SAN} _________________________________________________________ Envoyez des messages musicaux sur le portable de vos amis  http://mobile.lycos.fr/mobile/local/sms_musicaux/	1

Iran Pushes UN Intervention Against USURL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000643Date: 2002-10-07T21:35:22-06:00Yahoo: The Case for Regime Change[1].        Khatami asked the U.N. to set a deadline for Bush to step down in favor of     president-in-exile Al Gore the legitimate winner of the 2000 election, the     results of which were subverted through widespread voting irregularities     and intimidation.      [... This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major     U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led     by European forces. "Civilian casualties would likely be substantial," said     a French military analyst. "But the American people must be liberated from     tyranny."     [...] "Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles,"     said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. "Their     single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true     parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be     retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of     the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by     the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and     poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have     a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will     require many years."    Welcome news. The only way to crush America's fundamentalist tendencies is by showing them who's boss.[1] http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=127&u=/020927/7/2bxul.html&printer=1	0

ALSA (almost) made easyHi all,I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result isthat I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actuallytesting the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound qualitypeople seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit fromthat, right? ;-)I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packagesshould easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) andmaybe others, who knows ;-)Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :- Recompile the "alsa-driver" source rpm for your running kernel  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)- Install this "alsa-driver" package- Install the "alsa-libs" package- Install the "alsa-utils" packageNow go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/(very complete and very good documentation!)Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably needto stop many applications to free the sound resource...) "by hand" andinsert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! ("dmesg" tocheck is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels withe.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.With "aplay" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. Youcan also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3files... that's it!It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The onlything I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can'timagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.dstructure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with thedefault provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib'sdevelopment files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included staticlibraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version againstwhich the "alsa-driver" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in therpm release, so does the architecture!).I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!Download :http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/Current spec files :http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spechttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spechttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )MatthiasPS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simplyrun "xine -A alsa09" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)-- Clean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/Red Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10Load : 0.57 0.42 0.42, AC on-line, battery charging: 29% (1:55)_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list	0
[ILUG] PCTel modulesHello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type "make" after I get the output from the ./configure. However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing * cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config* make oldconfig* make depThe 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed "make", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after "make". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directoryThe odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated.

Don't delete this!!! ------------------------------------------------------ First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET! Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. "My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband earns in a year". The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered. He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet. As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of "Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom. "I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old. The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down, and finally to add your name to the top of the list. The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was going to work", the boy continues. Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills. "About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all". Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. "The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely had time for my homework". He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds. "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)." Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received. Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, "Please send me report number XYX".This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee. [This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions]. THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! ================================================== You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home!! Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ================================================================Here is another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials later but first: ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ======== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: ================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ================= For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. === When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.

Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits.

People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6....

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! ================================================================ **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================================ Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ================================================================ REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================================ Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. ===================AVAILABLE REPORTS ========================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! ====================== MORE TESTIMONIALS====================== '' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ================================================================ '' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''. Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ================================================================ '' I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. =============================================================== '' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 362,840.00.

Random hack Q: drawing on CDs with lasers?O utensils of the world --I wonder if it is possible to reverse-engineer the Reed-Solomon error-correcting codes to create a bytestream such that, when burned onto a CD, you can make out a picture in the diffraction pattern?I suppose this is a modern equivalent to line-printer artwork; I was imagining using a CD-RW drive to use the outer track, say, to spell out the disc title, creation time, etc. It would sure beat feeding CDs through a laser printer :-)Rohit	0

BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP(URGENT/CONFIDENTIAL)Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Standard Trust Bank Ltd, Lagos,Nigeria. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. Thanks and Regards, MR.VINCENT NNAJI.	1

[ILUG] VPN implementationI need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the thechoices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec whichis a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and issomewhat simpler to setup. The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sitesrun OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation ofIPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there asignificant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whateveron the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remotesites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexityin software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.Niall-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	0

This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater "Sensitivity / Responsiveness" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature "smokables" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This "Shangrila" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass! must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves "potent significance" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after "flowering" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all "viripotent," which makes this "gnarly stoke" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve "viripotency" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, "sensitive/responsive", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking ("Smoka") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!* Mill-stoned & honed.* Depressive regressive!* Psychologically uplifting!* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!* Sophisticated, well-balanced "ambiance."* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.* "Potentiated" & viripotent!* 4  5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.* Easy on, easy off!* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!* No "munchie" factor.* No failed drug tests!Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly "SweetGrass" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent "Smoka", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of "Smoka" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.)

Free Excerpt;  Baby Makers, Loser Choosers, & Welfare Abusers...Images of My America!                         ForewordAfter thirty?three years of being a black man living in "Ghetto America," an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the "Black Generation X". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of "Generation X". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed "Baby Boomers", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled "Generation X", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows:   "We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called "Xer's" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse.""We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong." This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these "similarities" speak primarily to only "white" issues and concerns. For instance, "they" say "we" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America "we" could only depend on one our mothers! "They" also say, " . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations," and " . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever." In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all "we" have time for. I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the "Black" from "Generation X" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. "White America" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled "Ethnic Notions." When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching "Roger & Me," another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical. Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with "Huxtable?like" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or "working class" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the "Huxtable?like" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our "dirty laundry". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that "black male and female generation X" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. Thinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our "male rapper" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. "The Big Tymers", a popular rap duo, have a song called "I'm Still Fly", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. ("Fly" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:"I got gator boots with a pimped out GucciSuit, can't pay my rent cause all my money'sspent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly."Worse yet, in the song "Grinding", the popular duo "Eclipse" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term "grinding" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are "grindingyou know what I keep in the lining" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and"Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers manI bake them cakes as fast as I canand you can tell cause of how my bread stack upand I disguise it as rap so the feds backup"In this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term "cake" or sometimes "pie") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al luded too. I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of "us" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. Additionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being "African?Americans", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as "Black", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as "Niggas," a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with "Nigger". The term "nigga" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term "My Nigga") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as "Ghetto", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. My commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by "White America". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design. There are other "core" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not "thugged out". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the "thug," and "drug dealer" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. These issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that "confused mentality" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American "ghetto" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that "ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into "Black America".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that "backward thinking" is the main  cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.************************************************************* To read More go to www.blackrealitypublishing.comTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.orgwith "unsubscribe freebsd-ports" in the body of the message	1

What Warren Buffett won't tell ya ...It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle schoolwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in thecafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just madethem a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,"and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investmentwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing theirlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,I promised to pay them even more the week after that,if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high schoolstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're notgoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out whenyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors andmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time tobuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keepyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is"NEVER".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an indexfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollarsin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard tomake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars inthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where wouldyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatilityis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to seethose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followedby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don'tcare if the market went up or down 20% this year as longit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successfultrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxingring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as helldon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firmto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in factso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spenda few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publicationsduring the past decade, and after using day tradingto successfully make more than four million dollars inthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't becomewealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is throughhard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeksbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practicalexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pullingclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to sharewith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn frommy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,secret formula for day trading that I've used profitablyyear after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost withinminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them. *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make.*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market! *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success. *** Profit on huge intraday price swings.*** Make money on the biggest news stories.*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximumreturns. *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street professionals use.*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. It's time to ask yourself: "Am I going to listen to the Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or amI going to take control of my own financial future, andstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"Who is looking out for your best economic interests - somewealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars.The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight-forward book ever written about active trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to yourown financial future.Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market.  Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the Californiacoast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day tradingis the fastest track to wealth.  If you're lookingfor a long-term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain'tyour kind of game.But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNEin the market, with the lowest element of risk, thenorder the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.

Re: The case for spamLucas Gonze:>Senders should vary the recipient list to include non-targets, like party >officials, and to exclude targets enough to give them plausible >deniability.Which means the sender has a list of who the truetargets are, and who the fake targets are, andscripts for mixing these. On the receiving side,my email client distinguishes between messagesthat are read, and messages that are not. I liketo mark or save messages that are particularlyinterresting or important to me. And even if Imake a point to delete "suspicious material"immediately upon reading it, even THAT mightleave an interesting kind of trace on my machine.Sorry, but I don't buy the argument that spamprotects people who want to distribute or seematerial the government disapproves._________________________________________________________________MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspxhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork	0

And I dont regretat all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you asa system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You joinonly if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of yourtime and efforts instantly and updated daily!

Unlike in other programs that give you no idea oftheir overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worstyet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying tofigure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing youwith the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>Howdoes it work</u>?.

Re: Goodbye Global WarmingThanks for the link - I'm fascinated by archaeology as well.----- Original Message -----From: "James Rogers" <jamesr@best.com>To: <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:48 PMSubject: Re: Goodbye Global WarmingI've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forumsfor several years.  I've always found archaeology interesting for noparticular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that Iactually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com--------------------------------------------http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htmDefrosting the pastAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bountyof a warming worldBY ALEX MARKELSAs he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, EdKnapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000feet. "It looked like a bison skull," the building contractor andamateur archaeologist recalls. "I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don'tlive this high up.' "Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from abisonone that died about 340 years ago. "This was an extraordinarydiscovery," says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that itcould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. "There'sprobably a lot more like it yet to be found."And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers andsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peruto Alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars andindustryhave shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. Asthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts isemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deepfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the muckyfringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of ourpredecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued."It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced throughstudying these remains," says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitudearchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National GeographicSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discoveredin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old "IceMan," found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, haveoffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, asthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasionaltreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before MotherNatureand looterstake them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains candeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they'reoften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon themdon't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier inBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was adead animal. "It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. "But when I lookedcloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a furtrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Locbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumedthe fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and whatseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunterlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long AgoPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (whomay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved humanfrom the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region couldexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in thefirst place. "Before this there was no archaeological record of peopleliving here," says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. "Now wesee that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities."Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedekcaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the southYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered incaribou dung. "It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't beencaribou in the area for at least 100 years," recalls Kuzyk, then awildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found "what looked like apencil with string wrapped around it." It turned out to be a4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of theice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layercakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800years of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to theice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discardedsome equipment in the ice. "We've got people hunting with throwing dartsup until 1,200 years ago," says Hare, who now oversees the researchproject. "Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwingdarts."Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. Theyare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on whereglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known tohave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangelland St. Elias mountain rangesthe United States' most glaciatedterrainand in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawingEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite asthe Ice Man. "Global warming is providing us high-altitudearchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We'reprobably about the only ones happy about it."	0

Re[3]: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...)In addition, one bit of anecdotal evidence from a conversation in1984! in San Fransisco is hardly enough to extrapolate 500 to 3k.This is the only quote I could find relating to promiscuity inhomosexual men."I think people feel a certain invulnerability, especially youngpeople, like this disease doesn't affect me. The publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say, "That isn't me. I'm not promiscuous." Promiscuity, especially, was a piece where people could easily say, "Well, I'm not. Promiscuous is more than I do." If you have 300 partners a year, you can think you're not promiscuous if you know somebody who has 500. So it's all relative, and it was easy to feel that that isn't me."You could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume.

There's good design and bad design. There's good testing and bad testing.  The problemis, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobodydoes.  I think "best practices" hasn't caught upon main street Web enablement yet.  There's somereally great packages on how to do this stuff andin fact the usability people knew that Web forms neededto be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XFormsand  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot andpeople usually do.  What the problem is, they don'teven recognize that they're gimpy--ever.  They justkeeping trundling along making a mess of everythingassured in their job security that they can buildWeb forms without even caring if they can beused or not beyond their test machine.If you had a piece of software and a security warningcame out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentallybroken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to knowis why would someone use Web forms best practices from5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in thattime.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windowsor Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled windowmanager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had fora brief period of time, but they are completely uselessexcept for some terminal based replacement applications. The bottom line is, if you can't get across thebridge, then it's broken regardless of whose faultit really is, and it's the business that needs to take responsibility as they are the ones thatwanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

Re: Gecko adhesion finally sussed.Jim Whitehead wrote:>Great, this is half of what I'd need to become Spider Man! Now all I need to>figure out is how to do that spider web shooting thing.>Heheheh... So becomming a university professor was your second career choice?  ;-)Seriously though (or not, as the case may be), The Amazing Spiderman had many other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his 'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a spider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city blocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not really well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey sense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result of some sort of quantum entanglement?Elias	0

SunWell, it looks like Sun are going ahead withtheir ubiquitous computing plans without Mithril. GregReuters Market News  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks   Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET   By Peter Henderson   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals  making computers which manage networks.   EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working  to make computers "self-healing" when systems break.  "Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box  it is running on," Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference.   Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever  needed.   For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from  different vendors to interoperate closely.   Sun promised to deliver a "virtualization engine" that would let administrators look at  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network.   "It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out," promised MacKay  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said.   Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response  time for priority users, the company said.	0

Re: Hanson's Sept 11 message in the National ReviewIn a message dated 9/19/2002 7:46:37 AM, chuck@topsail.org writes:>That means *you* can't say anything may not be FoRKed or printed or >whatever. You have the choice to ignore itThat's not what the First Amendment says at all. It says that Congress cannot say what can't be FoRKed. FoRK can establish any rules it wants. Similarly, The New York Times gets to choose what news IT thinks is "fit to print." If the Times chose not to print anything about, say, Rosie O'Donnell, it would be exercising its First Amendment rights, just as much as it would be if it chose to print something Rosie O'Donnell doesn't like. The necessary corollary of the freedom to say/publish what one wants is the freedom to refuse to publish or say what one doesn't like. The alternative is a state-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them news.The question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other specific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the "publisher" (if any) decides or the "community" (if any) negotiates or does as a matter of custom.For my part, I'd rather people didn't use FoRK as a place in which to dump an expression of their political beliefs.Tom	0

[ILUG] serial port transient failureHere's a weird and wacky problem:I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?Cheers,Waider.-- waider@waider.ie / Yes, it /is/ very personal of me-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	0

Internet saturation (but not in Iceland)Gary's news service at teledyn.com has an article on Internet Saturation.Let me ask you....If you were on a rock in the middle of the Atlantic, mostly in the dark for half the year, wouldn't *you* like a bit of internet distraction?   They've already done the obvious and fiber-ringed the island.Eirikur--------Latest guestimate stats from Ireland's NUA show a flattening Internet population growth. It seems there's two kinds of people, those who will go online with the status quo, and those who won't: Canada levels out at 53%, the USA at 59% (since 2000!), Denmark flatlines at 60%, Norway at 54%, Sweden at 64%, and the UK at 55% ... only Iceland continues unfettered beyond 60%. Could this be evidence of a usability barrier? If so, it's a clear signal that there's as much fortune to be gained from a substantially new Internet interface than all that has been gained so far.Latest guestimate stats from Ireland's NUA show a flattening Internet population growth.

/home/dudeHi,some time now the following messages were haunting me:     automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dudeIt just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed thisup. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*Binary file /usr/bin/aaxine matchesBinary file /usr/bin/gentoo matchesBinary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matchesBinary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches...I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saouhimself is "dude", and some package has hardwired a path in his builddirectory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using toomany of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.Regards, Axel.-- Axel.Thimm@physik.fu-berlin.de_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list	0

ADV: Internet marketing & communications; earn $100k/year... uleioHELLO...By reading the short Summary just below, youwill see how you can learn new skills in communication,do a direct marketing program on the internet, and at thesame time, earn $100,000 or more to enable you toCHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!************SUMMARY***************************Just read this Summary, follow the actions that it advises,and start earning some serious money.  You will learn newskills in communications and how to market on the internet.What a Deal!  Your total cash investment is just $50.00.Step 1.  If this is the first time you have seen this message,and you have not joined in this program before, thentake out five US$10.00 bills (total $50 investment), and mailout $10.00 each to the following people to purchase fiveGuides on communications.  For each Guide that you willbe ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain whitepaper, your own name, address, and YOUR OWN EMAILADDRESS, and the number and name of the Guide thatyou are buying.  Then fold the paper, put the $10.00 billinside the sheet of paper, insert the paper and $10.00 billinto an envelope, address the envelope with the name andaddress of the person whose name is shown under eachGuide below, and mail the envelope by first class or airmail. Be sure to put enough postage stamps on theenvelopes.  No need to send by registered mail.LIST OF FIVE NAMES****************************________________________________________________GUIDE# 1: "How to be A More Effective Public Speaker"Order Guide #1 for US$10.00 CASH from: (In addition toGuide #1, you will receive a valuable marketing Guide"A Million Bucks From the Internet", free of charge)Derrick Nguyen9530 Whitmore StEl Monte, CA 91733USA________________________________________________GUIDE # 2: "How to Give a Business Presentation"Order Guide # 2 for US$10.00 CASH from:Tim FaiGPO Box 260Macau (via Hong Kong)________________________________________________GUIDE# 3: "How to Write More Effectively"Order Guide # 3 for US$10.00 CASH from:Luis PastorApartado 8148080 BilbaoSpain________________________________________________GUIDE # 4: "What to do at a Social Function"Order Guide # 4 for US$10.00 CASH from:Chester Waldvogel11 Chestnut WayBerlin, MD 21811USA________________________________________________GUIDE # 5: "How To Sharpen Your Mind"Order Guide # 5 for US$10.00 CASH from:J. SidenKrondikesvagen 54 A83147 OstersundSweden________________________________________________END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save theseGuides on your computer's hard disk as other people will beordering these Guides from you, paying you for them andyou will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name andaddress of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace thatslot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4'sslot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.Check the address again.Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, andreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, andreplace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, andreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, andreplace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. Thisstep is how your own name and address is entered into thelist of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,your own name will go down the list of names until you havereached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. Thekey point is that the number of people ordering Guides fromyou will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send outthis new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) toas many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailingsyou make, potentially the greater the number of people whowill order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will thenmake new emails to send out to their addresses with the emailshowing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest ofthis email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 stepsshown above. Remember, the key point is to send out asmany emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and helpthose who purchase the Guides from you to send outemails of their own.Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediatereaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the listwith the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.That might seem to you like a clever move because newbuyers will be sending their money to these people.  Butthat move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.What will benefit you most is having people who will sendout emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to newbuyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going tobe sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself byeffectively closing down the program with your name ontop of the list of the names that you have inserted.  Therewouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuverwill gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have donethe work, and your name has worked its way to furtherdown the list, by then you deserve the rewards andearnings from that effort, and it would be unethical foranyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don'tdo it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 tothe five people on the list that one of the people will justtake your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, restassured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have youas a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to findnew buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try tocheat you or to "stiff" you for $10.00.  The people on the listwould rather have you working hard because your effort willbenefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers sendyou the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the dealby sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.******END OF SUMMARY************************=======REST OF MESSAGE======================With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success inthis business is now well within the capabilities of ordinarypeople who may not have done any internet marketing before.And the earnings potential is staggering!READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether aRECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you canafford to buy that new car or home that you have beenlooking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I neverresponded to one of these before either. One day though,something made me feel: "You use $50 going to a moviefor 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simplemeat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?"  No matter whereyou believe those "feelings" came from, I thank every daythat feeling came over me.I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doinghad I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator.What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image andconfidence and at the same time have the potential to recoveryour investment and make some good money: making overhalf a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about directmarketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketingvia the internet is the way sales and marketing will be donein the future, then the experience you will gain here couldbe a real boost in your work career, possibly even providinga new career for you.= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =If you want to make serious money, read this message untilyou understand it completely and feel confident to followthrough on what it advises.FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE ANDYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. Youare offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as suchand you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable periodof time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself andthe others on the list of five.===========================================*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHERCHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY===========================================Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and thatyou and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much betterbut let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people willsend out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only5,000 each.Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded alsosend out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out ofthose 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 ordersfor Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails eachfor a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% responseis 625 orders for Guide # 4.Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a totalof 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  Thismay seem a small amount to you, but remember we used avery low response rate with a small number of emails beingsent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rateup just slightly.If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyoneor half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000emails each or more?  From the example above, you can seethe power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is theamount of money from a small increase in the response rate.There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwideand counting, with thousands more coming online every day.METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET===========================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there areMany FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads onthe internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you startwith  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email theGuide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.The people you buy these Guides from will assist and adviseyou how to get the large number of email addresses thatyou need to send the new email containing your name andaddress.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides totheir email addresses.  This will benefit you because yourname would be further down the list, and their new buyerswill buy from you.  This is no different than "customerservice" in the retail or the  "bricks and mortars" business.===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============The reason for the "cash" is not because this is illegal orsomehow  "wrong". It is simply about time. Time for checksor credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing itis simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelopeand steal it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for eachGuide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hiddenby wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one ofthose sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAMEof the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESSand your name and postal address.  Be sure to address theenvelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps tomail the envelope.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOWFROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWNAT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL________________________________________________YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. Ifnot, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, andcash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANTTO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with adviceand instruction on how to send out more emails. You canKEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides peopleare ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATEMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILSAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!===========================================A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:You have just received information that can give youfinancial freedom to really change your life, but I don'twish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. Youcan make more money in the next few weeks and monthsthan you have ever imagined. Follow the programEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.Remember to email the revised copy of this email after youhave put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and movedothers to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of thepeople you send this to may send out 100,000 or moreemails and your name will be on every one of them.Remember, the more you send out the more potentialbuyers you will reach.IT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW ANDEMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!Upon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, theCopyright owner assigns to you two important rights:(1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet theGUIDE that you have purchased, and (2) the right to assignto your buyer of the GUIDE, the further right for your buyerto resell that GUIDE.

EnlightenmentI finally let go of my Irix Magic desktop and window managerand evaluated several other window managers. Having lost my 10 yearsof customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one pointat UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached toanother WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, Ihad a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this alongwith SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I amreally enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frillsfirst look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  Thenumber of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] Afterless than an hour or two of "nesting" I already have almostall my menus and controls setup just the way I want. I definitely recommend this to any Irix desktop holdouts.  It'sa great way to refresh your machine SGI without having to bite thebullet and rebuild it as a Linux machine.

Re: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its    hazards (fwd)Hi Kragen,   This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a coupleof nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market willbe well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that themost important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fixtheir systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, andyou allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so youmight want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.   There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is veryimportant, which is that research into defining and addressing classesof vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of availablevulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automatedmethods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, aboutthe quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research intoa set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that youcan define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time soyou can make and test predictions.   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, wewouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the securityadmin's job would be a lot harder.AdamOn Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 08:42:12AM +0200, Eugen Leitl wrote:| -- | -- Eugen* Leitl <a href="http://leitl.org">leitl</a>| ______________________________________________________________| ICBMTO: N48 04'14.8'' E11 36'41.2'' http://eugen.leitl.org| 83E5CA02: EDE4 7193 0833 A96B 07A7  1A88 AA58 0E89 83E5 CA02| | | ---------- Forwarded message ----------| Date: Thu, 22 Aug 2002 00:24:54 -0400 (EDT)| From: Kragen Sitaker <kragen@pobox.com>| To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org| Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards| | On August 7th, an entity known as "iDEFENSE" sent out an announcement,| which is appended to this email.  Briefly, "iDEFENSE", which bills| itself as "a global security intelligence company", is offering cash| for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software| that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell| anyone else.| | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a| very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.| | At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research| known as "full disclosure"; people who discover security| vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short| while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem| --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the| vulnerability, if possible.  | | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by| CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call "responsible| disclosure" --- never release working exploit code, and never release| any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released| a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers| vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked| on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people| wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem| was.| | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and| exploit these same holes for months or years while the "responsible| disclosure" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the| underground, vulnerable.| | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known| are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to| reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,| turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and| detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less| useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see| security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so| prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as| long as possible.| | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous| than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in| a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding| discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  | | Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently| including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the| secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software| vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to| Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if| HP retained Snosoft's "consulting services".  HP considered this| extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the| information.| | If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,| together, add up to a catastrophe.| | First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to| the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,| I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime| syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.| | Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will| become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be| --- just as in the "responsible disclosure" days --- that the good| guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority| of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.| | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the| vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's| plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets| them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the| people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when| credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.| Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site| administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some| negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.| | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability| information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to| execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that| means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who| are good at networked theft may not yet exist.| | There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as| Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR| than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in| Samba, for example.| | Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either| motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public| interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or| personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating| a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly| increase the availability of that information to the people who can| afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.| | Let's not let that happen.| | | | | This is the original iDEFENSE announcement:| | From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]| Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM| Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program| | | Greetings,| | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability| Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance| notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.| | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following| provides answers to some basic questions about the program:| | Q. How will it work?| A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish| security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number| of motivations, including the following:| |          * Pure love of security research|          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks|          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products|          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure| | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the| Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the| work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following| items:| |          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)|          * The amount of detail and analysis provided|          * The potential severity level for the information shared|          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other|            software and hardware potentially affected|          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs|          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE| | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?| A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other| entity.| | Q. Why are you launching this program?| A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions| to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More| often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the| original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is| compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the| public at large are warned in a timely manner.| | Q. Who gets the credit?| A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or| exploit information.| | Q. When can I contribute?| The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.| | To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have| questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please| contact us at contributor@idefense.com.| | Regards,| | Sunil James| Technical Analyst| iDEFENSE| | "iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively| monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and| hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code.| The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline| security professionals and network administrators with timely access to| actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats.| iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines| the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new| software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment."| | http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork| -- "It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once."               -Humehttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork	0
Hanson's Sept 11 message in the National Reviewhttp://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson091102.aspSeptember 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.The Wages of September 11There is no going back.September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take asuperficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simplybecause the sun still rises and sets.This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashinginto the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in realtime by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killersdealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting themanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, andcentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killinghas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morallyrepugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. Bylurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, thevampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats andbombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove onlyghoulish not fearsome.The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has foundthem both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicatethem and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quiteanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easilydodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make goodtheater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and Britishcommandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight andan occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence ofthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalistparadise on earth.Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition withEurope, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabeticnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the ColdWar. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade hasinsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft anantidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive poweris as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on oftendubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutallyexposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for themoment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressedthe problems inherent in "the European way" became all too apparent:pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstractmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, andconstant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shirewhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, withonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved moresobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered Europeanhobbits after September 11.America learned that "moderate" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostileIslamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaitimeans nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any morefriendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad oftheir anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to apre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learnthat broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States isjust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to comefrom friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistanoffer more long-term hope than "stable regimes" like the Saudis; governmentsthat hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royalfamily, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, whichhas snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democraticreformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamicgovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses asArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and themilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq "chickenhawks" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think ringshollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillnessagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slaveryended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all thosesoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno ofVietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is nogeneration of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousandbrave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been insustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because Americansoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic securityis lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up inlower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at thePentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather thanrejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroadas our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable athome. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots intoharm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infectthousands in high-rises.Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynicalconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimesrepellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loatheto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whosebelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they wereso often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists.No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive SovietCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Championsof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promiseopen economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments inthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, ifmulticulturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Westernconstruct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claimnonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not theLeft, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, andidealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican presidentastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and thesubsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, wewill see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.	0

Tech's Major Decline"Once we thought of the Internet as this thing with infinite capabilities.It was basically just a fad that came along."Missing from the article is the percentage of foreign enrolement, I wouldbet the numbers of students from Asia (China specificly) has gone up quite abit, and is the only thing keeping the overall numbers from plummiting."you can't get the chicks with that anymore."About time us geeks were outcasts again. I was getting sick of hearing aboutgeeks breeding and ending up with autistic children - proving thatintelligence is a genetic defect and a "do not breed" flag.)- Adam L. "Duncan" Beberg  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/  beberg@mithral.com-----------------Tech's Major DeclineCollege Students Turning Away From Bits and BytesBy Ellen McCarthyWashington Post Staff WriterTuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might havesought a stake in the "new" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming anace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imaginedtoppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried touse the Internet to end world hunger.But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboringdifferent academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to dosomething more social and more interesting than working with computers.Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, "youcan't get the chicks with that anymore."The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams ofsome fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the techbust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments hascome to a halt.The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. Andeducators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with somecolleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickledinto the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association ofComputing Machinery."I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramaticdeclines," said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineeringat Princeton University in January. "It can be hard to see this, because atsome colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so farexceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect."At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer sciencedepartment will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George WashingtonUniversity, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computerscience fell by more than half this year.Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in thepast decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science andcomputer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the ComputingResearch Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degreeswere awarded.The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be thefastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with othercomputer-related industries trailing close behind.But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes amongcollege students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studyinginformation technology and engineering at George Mason University werecomputer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major isdown to 800, although a newly created and more general informationtechnology major has attracted 200 students."Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief," said Lloyd Griffith,dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school."Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend fouryears on something and then not get a job."Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science majoris expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Marylanddecreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone doesnot account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College ofComputer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences."We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring theirinterest in pursuing computer science as a major," Halperin said. "That's afactual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expectto see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are nolonger expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off."Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is notconvinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on hisadvanced-placement exam in computer science."All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,so I looked for professions in which I could use those things," Yandziaksaid. "I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. Iwant to do something that will contribute to the practical world."Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association ofAmerica, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage."There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have thesame sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need thiskind of IT training right now,' " Miller said. "Our concern as an industryis that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down theroad four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going tofind themselves in a shortage situation."Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but otherfactors, including program difficulty, personal interests and socialinfluences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professionaldevelopment at the American College Counseling Association. The perceptionof computer science as an isolating, "nerdy" profession is one that many inthe industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground duringthe tech bubble but reemerged during the bust."All the hipness is gone," Yandziak said. "Once we thought of the Internetas this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad thatcame along."Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School inthe District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study businessmarketing, with the intention of going into real estate development."Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,"Thompson said. "To be honest with you, when I think computer science, Ithink of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's anecessity, but I wouldn't take it any further."	0

How unlucky can you get?So, last night around 5:30AM I'm woken up by a loud *craaack*, followed byone of the most dreaded sounds a homeowner ever hears: vast quantities ofwater spilling onto the floor. The water is coming from the bathroom, thetoilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilethad cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder whatare the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelainbowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it witha sledgehammer)?

Re: The Curse of India's SocialismI think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own "Permit Rajs" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?-Ian.On Tuesday, August 20, 2002, at 12:09 PM, John Hall wrote:> The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails> Everywhere Else -- by Hernando De Soto>> Is something I'm reading now.>> My impression is that France is not anywhere near the "Permit Raj"> nightmare that India is (and became).

[zzzzteana] Meaningful sentencesThe Scotsman Thu 22 Aug 2002  Meaningful sentences   Tracey Lawson    If you ever wanted to look like "one of the most dangerous inmates in prison history", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson - the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary muscle power.   Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48, has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at virtually no cost.   The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the exercise industry.   "I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it," is the opening paragraph penned by Bronson. "Its a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal!" You cant help feeling he has a point.   This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure.   Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the murder of "Babs" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an award-winning film.   Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer, a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received critical praise.   And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak.   So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound.   He says: "Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills.   "It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."   However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says: "Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine the very essence of who they are.   "They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something good?"   Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly two days during a jail siege.   Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: "I can hit a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."   But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists.   "All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket," he writes, in what can only be described as a refreshingly honest style. "We can all be fat lazy bastards, its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me."   As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside we all needed.

[zzzzteana] Cambodian Buddhaas unearthedhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2220132.stmTuesday, 27 August, 2002, 21:35 GMT 22:35 UKCambodia temple ruins yield treasureWorkers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda innorthern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in goodcondition and believed to be hundreds of years old.They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich templeabout 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn downduring the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area becameovergrown.Community careDeputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,when the last temple was fully operating," Mr Hang Sithim said.Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearbytown for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at thetemple to take care of them.''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor ofKampong Thom province.''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''Reign of terrorA police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 andcontrolled the country between 1975 and 1979.The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadentor culturally impure.About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodiainto a farmers' utopia. ------------------------ Yahoo!

RE: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60'sdraw the pain"Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it inworkshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. Youdraw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Takeabout 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefullylistening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurtsand where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes ofthis the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is toimagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay."Works!  There's this coworker - a real pain in my ass!  I used my middlefinger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds.  I listened to him, foundthe boundary, and repeated the motion.  He left my office!-----Original Message-----From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com]On Behalf OfStephen D. WilliamsSent: Thursday, October 03, 2002 5:33 PMTo: fork@spamassassin.taint.orgSubject: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60'sNormally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associatedwith fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would bethe difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, butrelated, relaxation techniques including "betagenics",hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics Iobsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /G-Force Dyno-Staff.I have to say however that, having found this while looking forsomething completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  Iparticularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, theMindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacularseem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs somereligion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Veryirritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare andcontrast with our (my) modern mental models.I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain andjustify US/UN foreign policy and actions.http://mindprod.com/methods.htmlhttp://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.htmlhttp://www.mindprod.com/(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)We create the world we live in.A loving person lives in a loving world,A hostile person lives in a hostile world.Everyone you meet is your mirror.You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offenceas when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is towaste what you do have.The past is dead,The future is imaginary,Happiness can only bein the Eternal Now MomentHow soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is thedirect experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.Love a person because he or she is there.This is the only reason.Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictionsand demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.Thepurposeof our livesis to be freeof all addictive traps,and thusbecome onewith the ocean ofLiving Love.sdw--sdw@lig.net http://sdw.stStephen D.

The Big JumpToday a French officer called Michel Fournier is supposed to get in a350-metre tall helium balloon, ride it up to the edge of space (40 kmaltitude) and jump out.  His fall should last 6.5 minutes and reachspeeds of Mach 1.5.  He hopes to open his parachute manually at theend, although with an automatic backup if he is 7 seconds from theground and still hasn't opened it.RObQuote:  "Vederò, si averò si grossi li coglioni, come ha il re di Franza."

We have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.Why do people sell their policies? The reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:Pay off debts Fund long term care insurance cost Eliminate costly premiums Take advantage of other financial opportunities Make charitable contributions Help family members    Life Partners Living Solutions   Traditionally, life insurance provides benefits only after death. With Life Partners, it can provide cash benefits for LIFE!   Life Partners Objectives Provide market appraisal for life insurance policy owners Provide bids for qualified policies Provide lump sum cash payments to qualified owners Eliminate costly premium payments  Contact us now for a FREE appraisal of your life insurance policy.

Kissinger[can't think of how I'd be runningafoul of the spam filters with thispost, so here's the second try...]Kissinger's book _Does America Needa Foreign Policy?_ provides a fewhandy abstractions:> The ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between> values ["idealism"] and interests ["realism"] and, occasionally,> between peace and justice.Also, he views historical Americanapproaches to foreign policy as abundle of three fibers:Hamiltonian - We should only get  involved in foreign adventures  to preserve balances of power.Wilsonian - We should only get  involved in foreign adventures  to further democracy, etc.Jacksonian - We should never get  involved in foreign adventures.  Unless we're attacked.  Then we  go Rambo.He has tactfully left out the hardrealists*; as for the rest I gatherwilsonians play the idealists, andhamiltonians act where values andinterests intersect, and jacksonians act only when values and interestsoverlap.Kissinger himself seems to be aHamiltonian; much of the book isabout how he thinks we ought tobe shaping the balance of powerin various foreign regions.Maybe I've been too affected byKant, but I can't see that sucha strategy works unless one cancount on a Bismarck runnning it:how lopsided does the US look ifeveryone tries to run a balanceof power politics?- -Dave*> The road to empire leads to domestic decay because, in time, the claims> of omnipotence erode domestic restraints.  No empire has avoided the> road to Caesarism unless, like the British Empire, it devolved its> power before this process could develop.  In long-lasting empires,> every problem turns into a domestic issue [which should be handled> very differently from international ones] because the outside world> no longer provides a counterweight.  And as challenges grow more> diffuse and increasingly remote from the historic domestic base,> internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent.> A deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the> values that made the United States great.Kings and tyrants generically havefollowed the same power politics:garner popular support by keepingpotential oligarchs down.  In othertraditions, a king is a legitimatetyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimateking.  In the US, I'd hope that we,like Samuel, wouldn't naturally makesuch fine distinctions.	0

[vox] Founding Fathers on ReligionSome interesting quotes...http://www.postfun.com/pfp/worbois.htmlThomas Jefferson:"I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do notfind in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature.They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocentmen, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have beenburnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of thiscoercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites;to support roguery and error all over the earth."SIX HISTORIC AMERICANS,by John E. Remsburg, letter to William ShortJefferson again:"Christianity...(has become) the most perverted system that ever shone onman. ...Rogueries, absurdities and untruths were perpetrated upon theteachings of Jesus by a large band of dupes and importers led by Paul, thefirst great corrupter of the teaching of Jesus."	0

[zzzzteana] And deliver us from weevilhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,806695,00.htmlWeevil pest warms to life in south-west LondonJames Meek, science correspondentTuesday October 8, 2002The GuardianThey're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancytaste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: theyare vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's coldwinters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also beendetected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh."This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory," saidMax Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in Londonwho discovered the creatures in the UK.The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormousdamage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously knownnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. "It's very likelythese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamentalplants from Italy," said Dr Barclay. "It looks like they're here to stay."He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department storein 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was amigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil insouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but hasestablished itself firmly in the same area.Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, andgrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. Thesoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation ofBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already afact.------------------------ Yahoo!

Re: Hanson's Sept 11 message in the National ReviewHeh, ten years ago saying the exact same words was most definitely not "parroting the party line".It was even less so thirty years ago. My story remains the same, take it or leave it. I've said the same words to white supremacists as to suburban leftist punks as to homeys as to French Irish, etc. etc.:I don't have to agree with anything you say. I *am* obligated to defend to the death your right to say it. I don't give a rat's ass where you say it, even in France. I don't care where the political pendulum has swung currently.ChuckOn Tuesday, September 17, 2002, at 10:38 AM, Owen Byrne wrote:> On Tue, Sep 17, 2002 at 10:19:13AM -0700, Chuck Murcko wrote:>> Probably because we have this pesky 1st Amendment thing here.

I personally doubt it simply because I neverheard of Bush and Chirac going to Brighton.Next time I hear a joke, I promise not to laugh until I have checkedout primary sources for confirmation in triplicate, OK?

Re: Ouch...LOL!  They're not doomed at all.  Thousands of men wear cb2000s to work every day (along with other chastity devices).    They are not just decorations.  You will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your keyholder allows you to.  Anyhow, I know better than to have this type of conversation with a 'nilla, but these men wear these happily, and consensually.  (:  There is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the people who use these.  There is power exchange instead.  Lots of variations on the definition, but this one's from Gloria Brame's site:Power exchange: the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the dominant. The exchange takes place when the returned energy from the dominant empowers the submissive. Anyhow, there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares to read them, but I assure you, the chastity device business is doing very well, and it is illegal to force someone to wear one.  It's not coercion, it is creative sensuality.

liberal defnitionsDepends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) overregulation.The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.It also has the ability to single out particular people, while overspending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be anexample of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spendingtons of money on public housing.As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to imposeboth, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion thatEITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is prettymuch anathema to liberal politics.Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for muchgovernment regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no privatereplacements, no government regulation) is better than governmentregulation itself.And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does notinclude everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is awatermelon.> -----Original Message-----> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf OfGeege> Schuman> > funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally> irresponsible.  which do you think is the worse indictment -> overregulation> or overspending?  there are many (dickheads) who buy into the> neo-conservative media's (fox's) definiton of "liberal" as "one whoseeks> to> impose both."	0

URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE.From nobody Mon Sep 15 18:00:02 2014Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitKEVIN GEORGEABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIEWEST AFRICADearest one,Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebelsin my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving nextof kin to my father.But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such atime that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helpingme to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684I remain yours sincerely,KEVIN GEORGE                                                                            ---------------------------------Yahoo!

You don't have to.  Shortof Palladium, you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold, includingreading messages and erasing the traces.  I'll buy a chocolate sundae foranyone who can show otherwise.An attacker might be able to verify that you *have* read a message (e.g.  by seeing that you saved and edited a copy) but not that you *haven't*.  If your email client was compromised you could put a packet sniffer on theline before downloading mail.  If an attacker installed a packet sniffersniffer, you could run it in a spoofing VM.The only exception to the rule that your machine belongs to you is --maybe -- Palladium.- Lucashttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork	0

Just you try to muck with Job's blessed Aqua interface.   Or remove the fscking dock.  OSX is such a step down from Classic with Kaleidoscope skinning the entire UI.  As an artist, I resent it deeply.   (This is not in praise of Classic.)  If my environment cannot be made beautiful, in some sense I cannot live.Eirikur	0

Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that its considerablyclearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the common practice ofputting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV cameras, visiting dignitaries,etc, further exacerbating those feelings."Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies" is now usually done by police with riot gear and pepper spray.We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably strayed from the permit area,which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance ministers held here (the motorcade droveby it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and arrested. Not very muddied at all.Owen	0

I think thelaws specialing out hate and protected speechare ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to makeis that there's only two types, speech and action. I agree, they are all speech and should be covered by the First Amendment, butIf hate speech is so protected, why are certainstates trying to prosecute people for it?  There'sonly two answers and one of them is wrong.  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to     have a different level of protection dictated     by whoever's offended at the time.  2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.     A action who's consequences are foreseeable by      any reasonable person. Hate speech is mislabeled.  It's really "threat".  I thinkthey let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantagein being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty andmoney through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEYdon't like.

[ILUG] semaphores on linux RH7.3Hi All,I have a question which is a bit tricky and waswondering of anyone has come across this problembefore or could point me in the right direction.I am involved in porting a SCO unix application toLinux, and we have encountered a problem with the waysemaphores  are being handled. The application usesmulitple processes to run application code with themain process known as the bsh which controls all i/obe it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handledvia semaphores.In certain circumstances the main process and theapplication child process seem to lock up both waitingfor the syncronisation semaphores to change state, Ihave attached ddd to the processes and it seems thatthe semaphore code is doing the correct things forsyncronisation but the processes stay stuck in thesemop() system call.I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delaybetween changing semaphore states the problem goesaway, but this causes our entire application to runreally sloooww !! lolIs there anything weird or different with the standardimplemenation of semaphores on modern linux that couldcause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in statein a semaphore immediately?Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails(-1) also fixes the problem but again systemperformance goes down the toilet.both the parent controlling process run as the sameuid, and the parent creates the semaphores withpermissions 0666.Any pointers would be appreciated!Rgds,Colin Nevin __________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Everything you'll ever need on one web pagefrom News and Sport to Email and Music Chartshttp://uk.my.yahoo.com-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	0

By having every single treeand building detail and similar, you can "see" even tiny dead spots due tophysical blockage and signal attenuation.  Overlay this with fiber map datafor yourself and your competitors (when you can glean such data), which isalso useful at this resolution, and you have a very slick way of modelingexisting network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing furtherdeployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth.  Take that and tie it into aslick geo-physically aware real-time network monitoring and managementsystem and you've really got something...For many applications though, 5-meter data is probably adequate.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com	0
[zzzzteana] US Army tests portable translatorhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stmUS soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portabletranslation device will be an essential part of their equipment. Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of aspeech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. "This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translationsystem can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,"said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper publishedrecently. The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly findingitself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. Speaking in tongues "In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody," RobertFrederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital.  Translators could be essential for US soldiers "In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other upand you are holding them apart. "You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on andtalk to them," he said. The portable translator was developed with a year, using commerciallyavailable laptops. The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. "The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals andtypically don't have any translation support," explained Mr Frederking. Slow system For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians whoknew just a smattering of English. The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words inCroatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translatedinto English and read out by a speech synthesizer. "It went reasonably well half the time," said Mr Frederking, though it wasslow in translating phrases. The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in thefield. But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made towork with further research and development. The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture betweenthe US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie MellonUniversity. ------------------------ Yahoo!

YOUR ANTICIPATED ASSISTANT IS REQUIRED.I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: Thanks and regards.

Please see the bottom of thismessage for further information and removal instructions.PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN INHIS CLOSET!Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely havejust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away whenshe came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buriedbeneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-oldsons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got whenshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles."My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-oldwoman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than myhusband earns in a year".The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership wherehe worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right awayand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little didthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking thanactually finding it in the closet.As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of "Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everydayafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on hiscomputer in his bedroom."I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my nameon it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever15-year-old.The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the topand move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name tothe top of the list.The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousanddollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with yourname at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail all the time, andreally did not think it was going to work", the boy continues.Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Boxthat his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptionsbegan to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills."About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my boxhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also ayellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought Iwas in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to thecounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride backhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all".  Overthe next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail."  Themoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in thecloset, barely had time for my homework".He had also been riding his biketo several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds."I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different bankswith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell thelady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange themoney] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me areally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for meand my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the nextbank down the street (laughs)."  Surprisingly, the boy did not have anyreason to be afraid.The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy wassending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it wascompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also inthe code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, whichstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received.Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,"Please send me report number XYX".This simple note made the letterlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee.[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand howthe system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before yousay "Bull", please read the following. This is the letter you have beenhearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entireshow to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it reallycan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not theprogram was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are"absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and ifpeople can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make somemegabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THISPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTERTHAN EVER.Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time whenI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent sothat the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using thefollowing company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept moneyfor reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad Ifinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimaleffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in".Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in themail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructionsand walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month Ionly made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, Ihave made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key tosuccess in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT changeanything." More testimonials later but first,PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to theperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.

To assist you with marketingyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide youwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulke-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and muchmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we willassume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let'salso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the responsecould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 millione-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUTTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOUCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a momentwhat would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those peoplemailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do justthat, and more!METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds ofFREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet willeasily get a larger response.We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 asyou go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them theReport they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on allorders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your nameand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until theyreceive the report.=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Alwayssend $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOTaccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Writethe NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++REPORT #1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the NetOrder Report #1 from:R.

I am anaccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving "junk mail". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of thepopulation and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jodytotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped inwith both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was onme! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.I have joined Jody in her "hobby".Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up mymind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided thatthe initial investment was so little that there was just no way that Iwouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back". "I wassurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed withorders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing aboutthis deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big".Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if Ishould have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someoneelse......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not deletethis one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the moneycame within 22 weeks".Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++If you have any questions of the legality of this program, contact the Officeof Associate Director for Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,Bureau of Consumer Protection, Washington,D.C.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This email was sent to you via Saf-E Mail Systems.

For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as(a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license thepatented bracing methods.  If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitaron eBay with "Gibson" written in crayon on the headstock, and thenclaim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would getupset.    M> Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away    M> is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  To play the Devil's Advocate here, it's not about giving /stuff/ away,it is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distributionrights.  Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn'tstop you from making 10000 copies to sell.    M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  This is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?The "other stuff" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harderto dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually preventspeople from doing it?Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do withsales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suitshould be able to "own" someone else's intellectual property.  SarahMcLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it'sthe label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildestdreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried uptomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's beenblazingly stupid with her money)But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow sothey can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problemswith beautiful-people deadbeat leech "friends" draining their riches,think again.The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until wemake the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,all it takes is looking at the same situation in a differentway.  Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans didthe work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, drivingmilk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills.  AllElvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen orcollect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted assomething of their own.  But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universalstatements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs intotheir own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans paybefore they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royaltiesfor listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, fora beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and overagain for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/favourite song????  That's where the whole system has been seriouslywarped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into yourthinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It's not.  It'sthe people who make them; the songs are already theirs.-- Gary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com"Computers are useless.

Both the person who gives sex formoney or power or companionship and the personwho uses money and power and companionship toget sex are promiscuous, in the broadest senseof the word. But their motives and behavior arequite different.Langur monkeys were the example in the citedarticle. "Dominant males .. kill babies thatare not their own." "The dominant male monkey.. seeks to defend his harem of females." Butcozying up to the current dominant male isn'tthe best strategy for female langurs, because"dominant males are dethroned by rivals every27 months or so." "By mating with as manyextra-group males as possible, female langursensure their offspring against infanticide,"by the male who is likely next to rule theroost.Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint apicture of carefree females engaged in joyouslypromiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver whois taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is abetter picture of that. ;-)_________________________________________________________________Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com	0

Too many kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more efficiently for how their kids are taught. >   > > > At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and> > > counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing> > > something wrong.> > > > > > Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way.> > > > > > > Maybe y'all should buy m-w some more bandwidth.> > m-w?> merriam-webster.

[zzzzteana] Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defectedThe Electronic Telegraph Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected  By Bruce Johnston in Rome (Filed: 28/08/2002)    Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.   Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena  Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine, contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.  Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.  Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.  As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.  Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back, was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.  Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers from video footage.  Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.  The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours. But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.  The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not grab their reins.  The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods' boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.  The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin.------------------------ Yahoo!

CBS News' interview w/Bush & reconstruction of his peregrinations"60 Minutes II" Bush Interview:(CBS) No president since Abraham Lincoln has seen such horrific loss of life in a war on American soil. No president since James Madison, nearly 200 years ago, has seen the nations capital city successfully attacked. But, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first great crisis of the 21st century.This is the presidents story of September 11th and the week America went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he remembers Sept. 11.I knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for some around the world to forget the mission, but not me, Mr. Bush says during the Air Force One interview. Not me. I made the pledge to myself and to people that Im not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So long as Im president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first hours after the attack.Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane been so central to America in a crisis.For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. Before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before 6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet engines echoed in Manhattan.Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.I thought it was an accident, says Mr. Bush. I thought it was a pilot error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a terrible mistake.Mr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just after nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was a coordinated attack.Back in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the news on his pager. The presidents chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in.A second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack, Card told the presidentWhen he said those words, what did he see in the Presidents face?I saw him coming to recognition of what I had said, Card recalls. I think he understood that he was going to have to take command as commander-in-chief, not just as president.What was going through Bushs mind when he heard the news?Were at war and somebody has dared attack us and were going to do something about it, Mr. Bush recalls. I realized I was in a unique setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident that we were, you know, that the world had changed.Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first words to the nation."Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America, he said in the speech. Today, weve had a national tragedy.It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didnt know that two more hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent ran in.He said to me, Sir, we have to leave immediately and grabbed, put a hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the door of my office, Cheney recalls. Im not sure how they do it, but they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.There wasnt a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice president, says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. We knew there were unidentified planes tracking in our direction, he says.Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice called Mr. Bush.It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get out of the West Wing, says Rice. They were hurrying me off the phone with the president and I just said, he said, Im coming back and we said Mr. President that may not be wise. I remember stopping briefly to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, Im fine. You have to tell everybody that Im fine but then settling into trying to deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I think the thing that was on everybodys mind was how many more planes are coming.The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President Cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the White House, no matter what.Its important to emphasize it's not personal, you dont think of it in personal terms, youve got a professional job to do, says Cheney.Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the capital.Says Mineta: Someone came in and said Mr. Vice president theres a plane 50 miles out, then he came in and said Its now 10 miles out, we dont know where it is exactly, but its coming in low and fast.It was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bushs limousine sped toward Air Force One in Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in the West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.I no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run, and suddenly the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and the whole White House just flooded out, she recalls.In Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling a Secret Service agent Be sure to get the First Lady and my daughters protected. At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications Director Dan Bartlett was on board.It was like a rocket, he remembers. For a good ten minutes, the plane was going almost straight up.At the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center Tower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche of steel, concrete and human lives.Someone said to me, Look at that I remember that, Look at that and I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and the horror of that moment, recalls Rice of the TV newscast.She also felt something in her gut: That weve lost a lot of Americans and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of course I felt the anger.Down in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.As the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether to shoot them down. I discussed it with the president, Cheney recalls. Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these airliners that have been hijacked? He said yes.It was my advice. It was his decision, says Cheney.Thats a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot down your own civilian aircraft, says Bush. But it was an easy decision to make given the  given the fact that we had learned that a commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it was, I didnt hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be done.The passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. The flight was 15 minutes from Washington.Clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of government as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too, says Rice.Meanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 minutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of its twin.The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure location somewhere in Washington. I was horrified, she says. I thought, Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can. It was a nightmare.By 10:30 a.m., Americas largest city was devastated, its military headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf Coast.I can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining moment in the history of the United States, says President Bush. I didnt need any legal briefs, I didnt need any consultations, I knew we were at war.Mr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the horrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, This is inexcusable; get me the vice president.I was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says the president. "Information was just flying from all directions.Chief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bushs ranch.I remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of different information, says Card.They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code name for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, Angel is next. The threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.It was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get the president home, Tillman says. We actually have to consider everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to make sure that no one knows what our position is.Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from air traffic control  a suspect airliner was dead ahead.Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with, Tillman remembers.Tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal traffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought that was a good idea, except the president.I wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back, says Bush.So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in Nebraska. Back in Washington, the presidents closest advisor, Karen Hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. Bush.And the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, sounded very shaken said, Maam, Im sorry, we cant reach Air Force One. Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the attacks. When she came back, it was a place she didnt recognize.There were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to see something like that in, in our nation's capital, says Hughes.When she walked into the White House, no one was inside. I knew it was a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, Hello? and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to the location where I met the vice president.On Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He didnt want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening to air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the telephone.We actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were heading, says Tillman. We, we basically just talked to 'em and said, 'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly across the United States.'Controllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning each other to keep the route secret.OK, wheres he going? one tower radioed to another.Just watch him, a second tower responded. Dont question him wheres he's going. Just work him and watch him, theres no flight plan in and were not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?Air Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed back: Air Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 oclock position.The staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows, says Bartlett. And the president gives them a signal of salute, and the pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.The men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander wouldnt tell them where they were going.He just said, 'Youll know when you see it,' and that was my first clue, I didnt have any idea what we were going up until that point, says Brotherton. He knew when he saw it.We, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around Air Force One, and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles, says Roberts.Bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this aircraft, or for his own safety: I looked out the airplane and saw two F-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to get us.We now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He hadnt appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, The American people want to know where their dang president is. The staff considered an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At 11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless, Bush said to the nation from Barksdale.At Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had a job for press secretary Fleischer.The president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that was said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed, says FleischerFleischers notes capture Mr. Bushs language, plain and unguarded. To the vice president he said: Were at war, Dick, were going to find out who did this and kick their ass. Another time, Mr. Bush said, Were not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.The President adds, I can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I said, Were going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you and Dick Myers, who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, are going to go get them.By 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that gave no hint of what they would find below.At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground Command Center. It was built to transmit a presidents order to go to nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. After a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference center which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.According to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls that Tenent answered: Sir, I believe its al Qaeda. Were doing the assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.The evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.A flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the seat numbers of the hijackers. That was the first piece of hard evidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and going through a process of elimination, says Mueller.In Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the nation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had enough. He decided to come back.At one point, he said he didnt want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him out of Washington, Fleischer says. That verbatim.On board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: I had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.As Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America collapsed, one of the nations worst days wore into evening. At the World Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in Pennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.Anybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil, Bush said recently.Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in Washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the way to the White House.Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White House to return to? I dont remember thinking about whether or not the White House would have been obliterated," he recalls. "I think I might have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to take our best shot.Mr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff were already working on the speech.He decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was reassurance, remembers Hughes. We had to show resolve, we had to reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.Just off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. Bush didnt think the American people wanted to hear it that night and he was emphatic about that.He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty million Americans were watching.Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts, he said from the Oval Office that night.The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House residence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White House daily log: The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. We think it's Osama bin Laden.(CBS) When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the president would do. In office for just eight months, hed never been tested as commander-in-chief.I never asked them what they thought, President Bush said of the Pentagon brass, because I didnt really  because I knew what I was gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and bring them to justice.In the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: The deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war, he said.To the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to strike bin Ladens organization well before Sept. 11.The president said, You know Im tired of swatting at flies, I need a strategy to eliminate these guys, Rice recalls.In one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didnt pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without a sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for came too late.Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for was literally headed to the presidents desk, I think, on the eleventh, tenth or eleventh, of September.On Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in the past.Well, theres a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway, Mr. Bush tells Pelley. A lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than they should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense (Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what we called boots on the ground. That if youre gonna go to war, then youve gotta go to war with all your assets.The president says he wanted to fight and win a guerilla war with conventional means.It was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director George Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and intelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the Taliban government.Secretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already developed a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an unconventional solution to an unconventional problem.As I like to describe it to my friends, Powell says, we had on the ground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some CIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the best in the world. How do you connect it all?The president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.Meanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day before, he had called the Pentagon the mightiest building in the world. Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.The next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. The Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.He wasnt real receptive to that, to that recommendation, remembers Brian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. And he ordered a hamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening and thats what he did.The next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the president. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.He sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it, says Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service later that morning.And I just scribbled a little note to him, Powell recalls, and I said, Mr. President, Ive learned over the years when you are going to give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will cause you to start to tear up. He looked at me and he smiled and then at the next break in the conversation he said, The Secretary of State told me not to break down at the memorial service, and that broke the tension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.First Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. I wanted the Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.It also stirred the mourners resolve, as Rice remember. As we stood to sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic, she says, you could feel the entire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.We all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.Next came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for what he encountered there.You couldnt brief me, you couldnt brief anybody on ground zero until you saw it," Mr. Bush says. It was like  it was ghostly. Like youre having a bad dream and youre walking through the dream.The president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men and women at ground zero began to chant, USA! USA!.There was a lot of bloodlust, the president recalls. People were, you know, pointing their big old hands at me saying, Dont you ever forget this, Mr. President. Dont let us down. The scene was very powerful. Very powerful.When Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, We cant hear you.The president responded, I can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.Mr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; hed posed with the firemen who always stood by whenever the presidents helicopter landed there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the picture were dead  lost at ground zero.When the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the faces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just missing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.At a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several hundred of these families in a convention hall.People said to me, Hell come out. Dont worry, Mr. president, well see him soon. I know my loved one, he will - hell find a place to survive underneath the rubble and well get him out. I, on the other hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and cry, but I remember the whole time thinking, This is incredibly sad because the loved ones wont come out.One little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his firefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the boy, Your daddy wont believe that I was here, so you show him that autograph.It was an effort to provide a little hope, the president recalls. I still get emotional thinking about it because were dealing with people who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved theirwives who loved their husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for all of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at times. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my tears, I see opportunity.The president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. The body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground zero.I called the police department, Howard remembers,  and they said he hadnt called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, No, I dont need to call back. If he hadnt called in, I knew where he was.George Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, and he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldnt stay away. The police department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.He (the president) he leaned over to talk to me, Howard recalls. And he extends his sympathy to me and thats when I asked him Id like to present Georges shield to him in honor of all the men and women who were killed over there.By the end of that day, Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained.He was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was emotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted, recalls Card..The next day  Saturday, Sept. 15 - Mr. Bush met members of his war cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting.My message is for everybody who wears the uniform  get ready. The United States will do what it takes, Mr. Bush told them.As Powell remembers it, He was encouraging us to think boldly. He was listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.President Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. On the other hand, he says, I wanted to clarify plans and I went around the room and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.When he left that meeting on Saturday night, he still had not told the cabinet what he was planning.I wanted to just think it through, Mr. Bush remembers. Any time you commit troops to harms way, a president must make sure that he fully understands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just spend some time on it alone. And did.What were his reservations?Mr. Bush says, Could we win? I didnt want to be putting our troops in there unless I was certain we could win. And I was certain we could win.Nine days after the attacks on America, before a joint session of Congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror.Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened, Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. Well remember the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end.A year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to remind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being waged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office, literally keeping score, one terrorist at a time.In his desk, the president says, I have a classified document that might have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about whos out there, where they might beAnd as the terrorists are captures or killed? I might make a little check there, yeah, Mr. Bush admits.But there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list  Osama bin Laden.(CBS) A lot has happened in the year since Sept. 11. One year ago, the president was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy. He had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. Now, on his orders, U.S. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did not expect, in a world completely changed. In the Oval Office last week, CBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq, about whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden.------------------------------------------------------------------------Scott Pelley: You must be frustrated, maybe angry. After a year, we still dont have Osama Bin Laden?President Bush: How do you know that? I dont know whether Osama bin Laden is dead or alive. I dont know that. Hes not leading a lot of parades. And hes not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he was. This is much bigger than one person anyway. This is  were slowly but surely dismantling and disrupting the al Qaeda network that, that hates America. And we will stay on task until we complete the task. I always knew this was a different kind of war, Scott. See, in the old days, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his tanks or his airplanes and his ships. This is an international manhunt. Were after these people one at the time. Theyre killers. Period.Pelley: But have you won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or alive?Mr. Bush: If he were dead, theres somebody else to replace him. And we would find that person. But slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al Qaeda network. And those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. And at the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary so that people dont feel like theyve got to conduct terror to achieve objectives.Pelley: Do you look back on the Afghan campaign with any doubts? Certainly, weve overthrown the Taliban government. Certainly, al Qaeda has been scattered. But some of the Taliban leaders appear to have gotten away. And there have been many civilian casualties as well.Mr. Bush: Uh huh. Well, you know, I am sad that civilians lost their life. But I understand war. We did everything we can to  everything we could to protect people. When civilians did die, it was because of a mistake. Certainly not because of intention. We liberated a country for which Im extremely proud. No,  I dont second guess things. Its  things never go perfect in a time of war.Pelley: Are you committed to ending the rule of Saddam Hussein?Mr. Bush: Im committed to regime change.Pelley: There are those who have been vocal in their advice against war in Iraq. Some of our allies in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, Turkey for example. Even your fathers former national security advisor, Mr. Scowcroft has written about it in the paper. What is it in your estimation that they dont understand about the Iraq question that you do appreciate?Mr. Bush: The policy of the government is regime change, Scott, hasnt changed. I get all kinds of advice. Im listening to the advice. I appreciate the consultations. And well consult with a lot of people but our policy hasnt changed.Pelley: On Air Force One you described the terrorists as evil.Mr. Bush: Yeah.Pelley: I dont think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same time, many in the Arab world are angry at the United States for political reasons because of our policy in Israel or our troops in the oil region of the Middle East. Is there any change in foreign policy that youre considering that might reduce Arab anger against the United States.Mr. Bush: Hmm. Well, Im working for peace in the Middle East. Im the first president that ever went to the United Nations and publicly declared the need to have a Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in peace. Ive made it clear that in order for there to be peace the Palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror and believes in peaces and quits using the Palestinian people as pawns. I've also made it clear to the other Arab nations in the region that theyve got responsibilities. If you want peace they gotta work toward it. Were more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it as well. But all this business isnt going to happen as long as a few are willing to blow up the hopes of many. So we all gotta work to fight off terror.Pelley: Arafat has to go?Mr. Bush: Either, hes, hes been a complete failure as far as I am concerned. Utter disappointment.Pelley: There has been some concern over the year about civil liberties.Mr. Bush: YeahPelley: In fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your administrations decision to close certain deportation hearings. They said, quote, A government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to the Constitution. Where do you draw the line sir?Mr. Bush: I draw the line at the Constitution. We will protect America. But we will do so on, within the guidelines of the Constitution, confines of the Constitution, spirit of the Constitution.Pelley: Is there anything that the Justice Department has brought to you as an idea that youve thought, No, thats too far. I dont wanna go"Mr. Bush: Nah, not that that I remember. And I am pleased with the Justice Department. I think that Attorney Generals doing a fine job, by the way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure that they review decisions we make, I think thats fine. I mean, thats good. Its healthy. Its part of America.Pelley: Franklin Roosevelt said that America should stand in defense of four freedoms. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want and freedom from fear. Do we have that today Mr. President? Freedom from fear?Mr. Bush: I think more than we did, in retrospect. The fact that we are on alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us more free from fear than on that fateful day of September the 11th. Weve got more work to do.Pelley: And Americans should not live their lives in fear?Mr. Bush: I dont think so. No. I think Americans oughta know their governments doing everything possible to help. And obviously if we get information that relates directly a particular attack well deal with it. And if we get noise that deals with a general attack, well alert people. There are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny and run down leads. And the American people need to go about their lives. It seems like they are.	0

If Habeas is going to die just because SA does notsupport it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that isnobody's problem but Habeas's.A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind ofincentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yetto think of an incentive that fits the bill ...On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Justin Mason wrote:> I don't see a problem supporting it in SpamAssassin -- but I see Dan's> points.> >   - high score: as far as I can see, that's because SpamAssassin is>     assigning such high scores to legit newsletters these days, and the>     Habeas mark has to bring it down below that. :(   IMO we have to fix>     the high-scorers anyway -- no spam ever *needs* to score over 5 in our>     scoring system, 5 == tagged anyway.This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in allits incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all rejectat SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop theirthresholds to 5.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Michael Moncur wrote:> But I agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that> frequently hit on newsletters.

Habeas is priced way too high -- a factorof at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-messagebasis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Harold Hallikainen wrote:> Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle> spam.

There's nobodyleft to charge except the people who want (or are forced against theirwill because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas tomake all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purposefor which it was designed.Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits againstreal spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rightsto use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've bothcreated and monopolized a market for "internet postage stamps" thateverybody has to pay them for.The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they doabsolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people withlawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectlyfrom everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for theprivilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'llever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.[*] And I use the term "they" loosely, because the whole company could consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeekWelcome to geek heaven.http://thinkgeek.com/sf_______________________________________________Spamassassin-talk mailing listSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.nethttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk	0

[zzzzteana] Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too farThe Electronic Telegraph Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far (Filed: 28/08/2002)    So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham or sick of Sheffield.  Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.  Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial Russia.  After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other side.  "The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet," said Kommersant.  "In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are becoming 'traditionally' relaxed."  The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.  It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also opening time in the nation's vodka shops.  And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that "the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their life.  "The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle of whisky for kopecks."  There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a halfpenny in sterling.  The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among diehard alcoholics.  While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British settler should overcome the difficulty.  "For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle."  One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the Mongolian border.  However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in which they would like to live.  France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country "where English is only known by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists".  Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.  Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common. And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.  Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the climatic problems, it said that "thanks to global warming this difficulty will solve itself".  Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.  "Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found amongst our citizens."  Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their preferred new home.------------------------ Yahoo!

Re: [ILUG] Sun Solaris..On Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 05:13:01PM +0100, Fergal Moran mentioned:> In a nutshell - Solaris is Suns own flavour of UNIX. Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail. Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can makesolaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship withsolaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar toother unixen like HPUX and SCO. Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. Oneof the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting yourhardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a softwareproblem, talk to the software vendor.' etc. If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. Thereis then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore. You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from acheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.John-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	0

Re: Java is for kiddiesOn Tue, 2002-08-27 at 08:58, Joseph S. Barrera III wrote:>> C is more reliable than Java??Both are reliable.  "Reliability" is more a function of the softwareengineer.  I've written complicated mission-critical server software inJava that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it issitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are runningmonths at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doinglots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sureevery conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recoversto a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is adesign/programming issue.That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and thenre-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as alanguage for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairlydetailed and low-level control of system resources to get aroundbottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't giveyou access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out ofa C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications youcould conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited byraw performance scalability.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com	0

Re: How about subsidizing SSL access to Google?Good idea!This could also be a job for P2P; lots of people would love todevote their spare cycles, bandwidth, and unblocked IP addressesto giving the Chinese unfettered net access.In a sense, this is what the "peek-a-booty" project does:   http://www.peek-a-booty.orgBut let's play out the next few moves:Good Guys: Google enables SSL access Bad Guys: Chinese government again blocks all access to Google domainsGood Guys: Set up Google proxies on ever-changing set of hosts (peek-a-booty) Bad Guys: Ban SSL (or any unlicensed opaque traffic) at the national firewallGood Guys: Hide Google traffic inside other innocuous-looking activity Bad Guys: Require nationwide installation of client-side NetNannyish           softwareGood Guys: Offer software which disables/spoofs monitoring software Bad Guys: Imprison and harvest organs from people found using           monitoring-disabling-software...and on and on.The best we can hope is that technological cleverness, by raising thecosts of oppression or by provoking intolerable oppression, bringssocial liberalization sooner rather than later.- Gordon----- Original Message -----From: "Rohit Khare" <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>To: <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:44 PMSubject: How about subsidizing SSL access to Google?[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with thearticle I was commenting on... Rohit]In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week ("TheSearch Goes On", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the mostsubversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, whichmerely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. Bymaintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforcethese rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and fromGoogle, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost allWeb browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading toSSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle;censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer inChina. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range ofIP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on inthe article.Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this trafficcosts real money. If the United States is so concerned about the freeflow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governorssponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the restof the Web?To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sectorprogramming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Justimagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secureaccess to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedomof the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and mostof it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting*the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...Best,   Rohit Khare===========================================================The search goes onChina backtracks on banning Googleup to a pointSep 19th 2002 | BEIJING From The Economist print editionIN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine,is gougou, meaning doggy. For the country's fast-growing population ofInternet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is provingan elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blockedaccess to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparentlybecause the search engine helped Chinese users to get access toforbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has beenrestored.An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. Moresophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult touse Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken byGoogle as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way forChinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet usersposted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internetproviders began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google siteto far less powerful search engines in China.Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts tocensor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blockingindividual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to befiltering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for keywords that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier thisweek when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search onGoogle for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in Chinausually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a searchalso rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.	0

[zzzzteana] That wacky imamhttp://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.htmlHamza's horrid - but we must tolerate himRod LiddleWednesday August 28, 2002The GuardianSheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeymanto scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playingwith his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do onstatutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on theway home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in thesea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchenfor once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America andmaybe me and you, too.But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since theBank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he soundedhappy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamicproto-warriors in the background.You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the DailyMail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eyecovered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don'tmock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whomwe don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves comeoff. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of theBritish right) as "Captain Hook", in articles which usually call for hisarrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybeoff to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years andthus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And ifwe can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force himto shut up.Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him beforeSeptember 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we allthought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into politicalpersecution.And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they'vegot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatorymanner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out ofcontext, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. Butperhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness andtolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror'sscoop.Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlierthis year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of hisallegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners weremeant to do stuff like that.He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have beenfrozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to themedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporationsand the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to betrue - Hamza is not "representative" of British Muslims, as if BritishMuslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one couldturn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he wasrevealed to be rather more "representative" than the list of thosegovernment-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorismand a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that anoverwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thoughtthe war against terrorism was a war against Islam.Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at thetime, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy athome and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone fromthe liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of USforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger actionagainst Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don'tsuppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was gratefulfor the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who hasbeen wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather moreinflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. Hisideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would behappy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, forexample. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterlyrepellent.And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desireto be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerfulappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by theruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views thatare antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothingremotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecutionis simply the pungency of his views.It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because hisrhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. Thisis a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. Andif British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense ofunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it isnot because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the manup, therefore, won't make a difference.It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.------------------------ Yahoo!

Keillor voices up on what to do with the WTC sitehttp://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtmlDear Garrison,There are at least six plans about what to do with"Ground Zero" in New York. I believe a suitable memorialsurrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions suchas a restaurant, small theater and a place for art workswould be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.What do you think should done with the space?Joe AdamsHillsdale, New JerseyI dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattanthat's designed by committee and that's gone throughpublic hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be coldand ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one morepublic space that the public hates, of which there areplenty already. New York is a bustling commercial cityand that's the beauty of it, it's a city of youngambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in thetowers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historicevents occurred in New York that in any other city wouldbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides andhistorical museums and in New York there's barely alittle plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking fortheir big chance, and compared to that spirit ofentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and astatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant'sTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about PresidentGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomband think about lunch, about sex, about money, about allthe things that New York is about. If you want to findGrant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in NewYork: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorialcity. New York is for the young and lively.	0

Goodbye Global Warming... and say hello to the cool:  Oooo ... /this/ is going to causesome stir ...http://www.atmos.uah.edu./essl/msu/background.html received viahttp://ontario.indymedia.org:8081/front.php3?article_id=12280Using satellites to monitor global climate changeEarth System Science LaboratoryThe University of Alabama in HuntsvilleFor Additional Information:Dr. John Christy, Associate Professor of Atmospheric ScienceEarth System Science Laboratory, The University of Alabama in HuntsvillePhone: (205) 922-5763 E-mail: christy@atmos.uah.eduDr. Roy Spencer, Space ScientistGlobal Hydrology & Climate Center, NASA/Marshall Space Flight CenterPhone: (205) 922-5960 E-mail: roy.spencer@msfc.nasa.govSUMMARYAs part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a "public" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.GATHERING THE DATAWhile traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their "brightness" - varies according to temperature.Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTSA recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a "remarkable" level of agreement between the two.To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by "radiosonde" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions."The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement," Christy said. "If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else."The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service."These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet," Christy said. "They are not representative of the total globe."Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.GLOBAL COVERAGEOne advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. "Radiosonde" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard "ships of opportunity." The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSUWith nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERSOf great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local "asphalt effect" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITYWhile the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.THE SCIENTISTSIn 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored "for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate."AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.DR. JOHN CHRISTYChristy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987, after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno, his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, and his M.S. (1984) and Ph.D. (1987) degrees in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois.He was an instructor of mathematics at Parkland College in Champaign, IL, 1983-87, an instructor of mathematics at the University of South Dakota, 1981-82, and an instructor of mathematical sciences at Yankton (S.D.) College, 1980-81.He also served as pastor of the Grace Baptist Church in Vermillion, S.D., 1978-82, and as science master at Baptist High School, Nyeri, Kenya, 1973-75. He has published more than 20 refereed scientific papers.Christy serves on the NOAA National Scientific Review Panel for the National Climatic Data Center, and on NOAA's Pathfinder Review Panel. He was an "invited key contributor" to the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's scientific assessment of climate change, and served as a contributor to the 1992 and 1994 IPCC reports.DR. ROY SPENCERSpencer began his career as a research associate at the Space Science and Engineering Center in Madison, WI, in 1981, after earning his B.S. (1978) in meteorology at the University of Michigan and his M.S. (1979) and Ph.D. (1981) degrees in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was a Universities Space Research Association visiting scientist at MSFC, 1984-87, before joining the MSFC staff in 1987.He is the U.S. team leader for the Multichannel Microwave Imaging Radiometer Team and has served on numerous committees relating to remote sensing. He directs a program involving satellite and aircraft passive microwave data to build global climate data sets and to address climate research issues. Spencer is lead author on sixteen scientific papers.BIBLIOGRAPHY(1) J.R. Christy, 1995, "Climatic Change," Vol. 31, pp. 455-474.(2) J.R. Christy, R.W. Spencer and R.T.

(When it wasapparent that TCP networks were useful,berkeley sockets could be found evenon VMS and Win 3.1 boxen)Why would early Unix have run with theidea that, if one wishes to do multiplethings at the same time, one can use agroup of processes to do them?- they had Multics as a counterexample?- in the days of tiny memories and tapes,  people were more accustomed to writing  programs that didn't run entirely in a  single address space?- one is a great number for an interface,  as log(1) is 0, and specification can  be implicit?- some combination of the above?Now, as Hoare says:> There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make> it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to> make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.As programmers, we've been able to makeour lives complicated for at least halfa century; the hardware interrupt givesus the rope.Part of Dijkstra's inspiration for THEwas the counterexample of IBM's multi-programmed boxes (were these the sameones that inspired Mythical Man Month?)and I suppose he would say the questionis how not to make a mess of it -- howshould we structure computations so ifwe try to do ten times as many thingsat the same time, reasoning about theresulting system is at most ten timesmore complex -- not one hundred, andcertainly not three and a half milliontimes more.Compared to that project, the prospectof writing a driver library for variousvendors' aio implementations seems tobe truly trivial.-Dave(Oracle, in their quest for portability,used to use raw disks for the database.This finessed the filesystem issue; didit also allow them to roll their own setof async drivers?)	0

Re: Wifi query802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range (also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for more reliable data transmission.Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much interference or too many clients.Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a directional antenna either way.Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.Give me bandwidth or give me death,EliasTom wrote:>...

Making a mesh on the movehttp://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0%2c3858%2c4489999%2c00.htmlMaking a mesh on the moveA new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, reports Peter RojasPeter RojasThursday August 29, 2002The GuardianImagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever dream.Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time "mesh-enabled" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central antennas, and improving wireless coverage.As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless networking may be inevitable.Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless connection.Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around £100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by software.It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds acquiring 3G licences.All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone networks.But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of their favourite songs, movies, and video games.But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for enterprise networks.The first place average users may use the technology is when it is incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.	0

The Disappearing Alliancehttp://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-100802BThe Disappearing AllianceBy Dale Franks 10/08/2002For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been ourclosest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of theCold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Wecelebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberationof Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology thatHudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed "progressivetransnationalism". The key doctrines of this form of post-communistprogressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are thedeconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas ofcitizenship (i.e. a "global" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, andthe pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as theUnited Nations.The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through thepooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While thereis a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelectedEuropean Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limitsto their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, whereelected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has anappointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes ofthe people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desiredby the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justiceregularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU membergovernments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list ofcomplaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the factthat our republican system of government is not based on proportionalrepresentation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despisethe fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economyis so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywherein the world.On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independentnewspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should berestrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decadeor so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because itexaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather becausethe impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion ofthe US literally fantastic.At least, for now.Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the factremains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the Europeanintellectual and political elite.The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps incheck the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such asystem in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannotunderstand why America places a higher value on the ethos of nationalsovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than itdoes on compliance with international "norms." They view all departuresfrom such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equalvote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since theprocess is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The troublewith this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democraticsocieties. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusalsto join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve theliberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because itsdictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated referencesto the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions tocomply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on acommitment toconstitutional rights.None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, orcooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism infavor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, whiletheir tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such apolitical atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitablyincrease.That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is thethought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of thenew ideology of transnational progressivism.-- -----------------R. A.

RE: Goodbye Global Warming> "the historical record", by which you mean *human* historical record, is> highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological> timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations.The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to humanactivity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and acceleratingafter WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe thatthese increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent forincreased global warming.

I don't see any compelling reason to "save> the glaciers" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their> existence has always been transient.Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in thepast have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warmingisn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is tounderstand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures onglobal human activity.> For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are> anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'll> just stick with Occam's Razor for now.The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environmentsubject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is thecurrent best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earthshould be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and maybe difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. Iencourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 toeventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evidentas heat.- Jim	0

Best news yetINVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. Research Alert - UndervaluedAugust 26, 2002XrayMedia(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!How does the company do this? XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a "mass source to advertising sector " live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. Their "source to business model", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon. *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. *** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. *** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings "substantially" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

Hettinga" <rah@shipwright.com>Subject: Re: Electric car an Edsel...Date: Tue, 3 Sep 2002 22:49:20 -0600Bob,This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it wellthought out.Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors,called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltageregulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughlythe energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kineticenergy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- ina vacuum.Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much doesthe 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I betit isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially storedelectrically in the capacitor.  And it's not at all obvious that the torquevs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they doit without wheels, drive train, etc.But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!On to the Lunarnationals?

NYTimes.com Article: Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to SpendThis article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.Texas Pacific, in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below, actually does invest in promising new companies, not just turnarounds. It's just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their $7.2B portfolio... so far!Rohitkhare@alumni.caltech.eduTexas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to SpendAugust 25, 2002By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG  It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed whenhe became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airwayslast March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leanerand meaner business plan, keep his planes flying andrenegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flippedthrough his files and found the number for the TexasPacific Group, an investment firm headed by DavidBonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputationfor fixing problem companies. Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filedfor bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake inAmerica West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not letTexas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? askedRichard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.Siegel reached. In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And daysbefore US Airways announced its plans to file forbankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiatedabout $550 million in concessions with its unions - TexasPacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed tokick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keepthe company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed tobuy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emergesfrom bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with abetter offer. "One of the reasons we were interested is few other folkswere," said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, inan interview after the bankruptcy filing. "There aren'tmany people around with the stomach or the knowledge todelve into the airline industry." Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buyingbusinesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bondermanmade their names during the recession of the early 1990'swith investments in Continental and America West. Thefirm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shapingcompanies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping itsextensive network of contacts for talented replacements. Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the lastyear alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed sixacquisitions, most in unloved industries likesemiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has beenlosing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also biddingfor Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of thesedeals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November ofMEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150million bank loan. In the last few years, most firms that specialize inleveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans andother borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have mademanagements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that arefor sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. Texas Pacific is different. "This is a terrific environmentfor them," said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of theBlackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of theWest, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: "Mostother buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.You don't see many guys wanting to take on operationalfixes." Like most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keepits inner workings private: its partners rarely grantinterviews and its Web site is perpetually underconstruction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed forthis article. Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts andbright, patterned socks. "He likes argyle socks, and theytend to fall down around his ankles," said Henry Miller, aninvestment banker who advises troubled companies. Early inhis career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bondermanargued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is knownfor obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekkingin places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan."Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up onmy caller I.D., I know it's David calling," said oneinvestment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as thechief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by makingearly bets in industries like cable television and takingstakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,which had been seized by the government. Over nearly adecade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annualreturn of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had alsoworked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year withMr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. The three men have complementary skills, investment bankersand other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the masterstrategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals andthe detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Priceoften recruits managers and advises on operational issues. "David is very much the optimist, very much the dealmaker," said Greg Brenneman, a former president ofContinental. "Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He willapproach investments a little bit more skeptically thanDavid does." By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was wellestablished in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billionfrom pension funds and other investors in early 2000. Tocelebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented SanFrancisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at aparty. But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacifichesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made nodeals. They checked out some of the biggest corporateblowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, butstayed away, finding the prices and the quality of thebusinesses untenable. Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existinginvestments, taking more than $2 billion in profits duringthat stretch. "They started to cash out early in the cycle," said MarioGiannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a moneymanagement firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacificinvestors. The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for TexasPacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies thatneeded its help. But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in therough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the healthmaintenance organization that nearly collapsed in themid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in newmanagers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italianmotorcycle maker, whose profits have since more thanquadrupled. But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought atthe top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 millioninvestment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, forwhich it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase ofBally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demandfor luxury goods. Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, asemiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,both of which filed for bankruptcy. Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm'sperformance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings intwo investment funds it raised over the last decade. Thefirst fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 andincluding investments made through March 1997, shouldreturn more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacificinvestor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997- could return less than half that, this investorestimated, since the firm had less time to take profits onthese investments before the stock market sank. But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdingsin the second fund, profits on these investments couldrebound. It is hoping, for example, that with newmanagement in place, J. Crew will turn around as theeconomy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, "theirreturns look pretty good when you consider that some otherfunds won't return any capital" to investors. But with the weak economy throwing many companies intotrouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earliersuccess, the investor said. "They should do exceptionallywell," he said. Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. Itrelies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructuretroubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, exceptfor surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, itreplaces managers. Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as hisold friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led itto the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, thenbrought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, andin October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chiefexecutive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaulof the company and is now considered a great turnaroundartist of the industry. "The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with BobFerguson," said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel forthe Federal Aviation Administration, in describing thethinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982Braniff bankruptcy. "He chose Bethune over his longtimefriend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do abetter job." At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even moreextensive management overhaul. This time, the charge wasled by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job ofchief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.Parker said the two men quickly realized they had "somewhatkindred spirits." The board replaced most senior managers at America West,except William Franke, the chief executive, who steppeddown last September. His restructuring plan had made theairline profitable a year and a half before it emerged frombankruptcy in August 1994. Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worthabout $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, andthe group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. "These are not passive investors, nor am I," said Donald L.Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental'sboard with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. "You're active.Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake." After overseeing managers who worked successfully withunions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has agood reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airwayswas interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said ChrisChiames, a spokesman for the airline. Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would "be as laborfriendly as possible," Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways canstill entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, thebillionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressedinterest. Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made withGoldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after twoyears of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and thechain's franchisees - even before the company, which hadbeen owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up forsale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the NationalFranchisee Association, which represents most Burger Kingfranchisees. "We liked what they had to say about the human component ofthe businesses they buy," Mr. Josephson said. Many otherowners, he added, "are dismissive of labor." At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with anexecutive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is JohnDasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwestbought out their stake in Continental in 1998. Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamoredwith the technology industry, despite the failure of somany start-ups the last two years. It has focused on thesemiconductor industry, which like the airline industry ishighly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. The firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two andtook both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most ofits stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much largerinvestment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chipmaker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis inAsia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed forbankruptcy last year. Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a thirdcompany, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more lastyear. Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing thepayment to E.On, based in Düsseldorf, Germany, was actuallymore than the acquisition, one executive close to the dealsaid. Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Companyof the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed toguarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. TexasPacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most ofwhich it swapped for more stock in the company. "They did a good job of timing the acquisition," saidNabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who notedthat in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profitsince the fourth quarter of 2000. But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearlysizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, AmericaWest and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discountticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines toinvest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, asPriceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web sitebut does not reveal the exact flight and travel time untilafter the sale. The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurtHotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said thatthe company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacificremains committed to it. Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen totalk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bondermanseemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down thesteep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,Mr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,Mr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet.   http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/business/yourmoney/25TEXA.html?ex=1031278887&ei=1&en=05fca479b8bcee6bHOW TO ADVERTISE---------------------------------For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contactonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfoFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

They can grow to 4ft in length.Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidenceon 08705 555 999.------------------------ Yahoo!

Re: AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big BucksGary Lawrence Murphy:>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I usedthe term "alcoholism," implying addiction. Idrink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drinkdon't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AAmeetings do (try very hard) not to drink.As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky inalmost any degree. Were I single, I might considerpotential mates who partook of the less irrationalor more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian orBuddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccanof the second. But someone who is both irrationaland serious about that irrationality strikes me asa bad choice of partner, moreso than someone whowas addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drugaddicts at least have the sense to battle theirproblem, and to keep their children from sufferingit. The religious revel in their irrationality,and want to raise their children in it. That's adifficult difference for two parents toreconcile.Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored ofsomeone who has no religious tendencies._________________________________________________________________Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com	0

The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14)--------------------------------------------------------------------------What is MIME?MIME stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions".  It is thestandard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using theworld-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sendingimages, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain textfiles when it is important that the mail system does not modify any partof the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that arecipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message?Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in usewhich do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growingnumber of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popularMIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at theUniversity of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the hostftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translationcapability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you donot have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there isstill hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIMEmessage.  One of the more versatile is called "munpack".  It was developedat Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from thehost ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versionsavailable for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility witholder forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can alsodecode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE?Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files sothat they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technicallimitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robustencoding called "Base64" which has been carefully designed to survive themessage transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME?The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available viaanonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including:                                                             o  US East Coast                                    Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)                                                                     o  US West Coast                                    Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)                                                                   o  Pacific Rim                                      Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)                                                               o  Europe                                           Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txtAnother source of information is the Internet news group "comp.mail.mime",which includes a periodic posting of a "Frequently Asked Questions" list.--------------------------------------------------------------------------http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork	0
More on promiscuity and word choice Re: Selling Wedded Bliss (was    Re: Ouch...)Robert Harley writes:> >OK, then. Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each> >pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him "Wilt",> >also has sex with the other 499,999 women> > This has never happened.  Its relevance is nil.It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the point of the earlier 3-person example. But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice ofvalues results in meaningful differences between the sexes' "promiscuity", as commonly understood. It should be more obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without sayingso outright, this model actually approximates the cliche "common wisdom" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you reverse the male and female roles.Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiplepartners -- men being "more promiscuous" than women -- and that surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled "sluts").> So I chose not to type "on average" explicitly in my post, since this> is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.> > There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested> in typical behaviour and you in extreme. Nope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement tomake it more defensible. What I objected to was:Robert Harley:# >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous# >than males simply does not fit the facts, Hrdy contended.# # Well, DUH!!!# # It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,# precisely identical between males and females.# # Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have neededto jump in with a patronizing "DUH!!"? If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have huffed and puffed with the words "perfectly obvious" and "exactly, precisely identical"? If your concern was with the "typical", why didn't you adopt the typical definition of "promiscuous", rather than a straw-mandefinition which allowed you to interject "DUH!!" and mock ananthrolopology professor's conclusions? > Actually, you probably just> had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.You are welcome to that theory!But here's an alternate theory: when you jump in with a patronizing and overblown pronouncement -- e.g. "DUH!!... perfectly obvious... exactly, precisely identical..." -- and that pronouncement is itself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of popping your balloon. - Gordon	0

Ack, apt-get still failing for me, stumped. [RH8]I posted about this last week, and I'm still stumped.  apt-get is justnot working for me, and I can't figure out what the problem is.I've tried removing the apt rpms, making sure to remove any traces leftbehind (/etc/apt /var/state/apt /var/cache/apt), and still, I get"couldn't find package xmms-mp3" when running "apt-get install xmms-mp3".Any clues?  Here's a log of a fresh try:root@canarsie:/tmp # rpm -e apt apt-develroot@canarsie:/tmp # rm -rf /etc/apt /var/cache/apt /var/state/aptroot@canarsie:/tmp # rpm -ivh apt-0.5.4cnc7-fr1.i386.rpm apt-devel-0.5.4cnc7-fr1.i386.rpmwarning: apt-0.5.4cnc7-fr1.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key IDe42d547bPreparing...                ########################################### [100%]   1:apt                    ########################################### [ 50%]   2:apt-devel              ########################################### [100%]root@canarsie:/tmp # apt-get updateIgn http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386 releaseGet:1 http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386/os pkglist [1276kB]Get:2 http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386/os release [108B]Get:3 http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386/updates pkglist [14B]Get:4 http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386/updates release [113B]Get:5 http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386/freshrpms pkglist[57.1kB]Get:6 http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386/freshrpms release[125B]Get:7 http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386/os srclist [152kB]Get:8 http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386/updates srclist [14B]Get:9 http://apt.freshrpms.net redhat/8.0/en/i386/freshrpms srclist[14.4kB]Fetched 1500kB in 11s (125kB/s)Reading Package Lists...

[zzzzteana] A New Theory on Mapping the New Worldhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46455-2002Oct5.htmlA New Theory on Mapping the New WorldBy Guy GugliottaWashington Post Staff WriterMonday, October 7, 2002; Page A07In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary mapof the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus andothers into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent"America." With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.But there was something else. What would later come to be called SouthAmerica and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on theeast coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast-- which no European was known to have seen.The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction ofmodern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the rightgeographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printedalong its top.The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of thecurvature of the Earth.It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- waspublished six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus ofPanama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around theworld.Did someone get there earlier?...------------------------ Yahoo!

That's wrong,immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers andthe protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus orsome of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me.

Most of the people that are protesting against takingout the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.They simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal publiclisten to them on matters of national security?So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn't Hussein be taken out? And if youranswr boils down to "i don't give a shit about what happens to the US", youcan kiss my ass :-)Bill	0
[zzzzteana] Plumstead Panther - Pictures!Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence...A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.htmlSecurity cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the catThe Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley in just four weeks.Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security cameras captured it on film.The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.He said: "It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of a hunter."It looked at me calmly before moving on."The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news of the sighting.His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images of the large cat prowling through their garden.She said: "I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate for it to get hurt."Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at "nothing" in the garden but barked that morning.He warned: "I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they might jump you."Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.12:27 Tuesday 8th October 2002_________________________________________________________________Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com------------------------ Yahoo!

[zzzzteana] Betamax finally laid to restNot fortean, but a moment in time all the same...http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stmBetamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years afterlosing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000more machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.  VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was betterquality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for thefilm rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. "With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in themarket, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult tosecure parts," Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for theformat. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in thetelevision and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffinfor Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face ofcompetition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,although VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but nonew ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

The document, entitled "The National Security Strategy of the> United States," will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of> the Administration's policy.>> INTRODUCTION>> THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and> totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of> freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,> democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only> nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and> guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the> potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People> everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;> worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own> property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom> are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of> protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of> freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.>> Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military> strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our> heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for> unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that> favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies> can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and> economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the> world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace> against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace> by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the> peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.>> Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental> commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed> dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great> industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of> individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less> than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to> penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies> against us.>> To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --> from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and> cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global> reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help> nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will> hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the> allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and> countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop> new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every> turn.>> The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism> and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking> weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing> so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to> succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other> means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny,> contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous> technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America> will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We> cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must> be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence> and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who> saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have> entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.>> As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic> opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community> has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the> seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace> instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers> find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist> violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common> interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by> common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching> for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese> leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of> national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political> freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage> the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,> because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and> international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great> powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,> trade, and cultural advancement.>> Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend> the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring> the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to> every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us> that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our> national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people> into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and> corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and> drug cartels within their borders.>> The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a> better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free> trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies> out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual> nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to> build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.> The United States will deliver greater development assistance through> the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly,> invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also> continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of> AIDS and other infectious diseases.>> In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is> guided by the conviction that all nations have important> responsibilities.

Overview of America's International Strategy>>> "Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We> fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors> liberty.

And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and> open societies on every continent.">>>>>>> President Bush> West Point, New York> June 1, 2002>>>> The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength> and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of> liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with> unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great> strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that> favors freedom.>> For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great> struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and> equality.>> That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and> race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and> discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we> are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by> catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must> defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.>> This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to> translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,> and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a> distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our> values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help> make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to> progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations> with other states, and respect for human dignity.>> And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.>> To achieve these goals, the United States will:>> * champion aspirations for human dignity;>> * strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent> attacks against us and our friends;>> * work with others to defuse regional conflicts;>> * prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our> friends, with weapons of mass destruction;>> * ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and> free trade;>> * expand the circle of development by opening societies and building> the infrastructure of democracy;>> * develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of> global power; and>> * transform America's national security institutions to meet the> challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.>>> II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity>>> "Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the> language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require> different methods, but not different moralities.">>>>>> President Bush> West Point, New York> June 1, 2002>>>> In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we> stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because> these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation> owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and> mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live> free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be> oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of> the secret police.>> America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human> dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state;> free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women;> religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.>> These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served> us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures,> facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these> core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not> been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and> aspirations of their people.>> Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in> our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of> Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a> stronger, but is a freer and more just society.>> Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And> when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central> and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When> we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in> the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin> America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can> evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all> cherish.>> Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,> the national security strategy of the United States must start from> these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.>> Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international> cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation> of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international> bodies.>> We will:>> * speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of> human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to> advance freedom;>> * use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who> struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward> democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;>> * make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key> themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation> from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights> to move toward a better future; and>> * take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience> and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.>>> We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist> it.>> III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent> Attacks Against Us and Our Friends>>> "Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have> the distance of history.

(The National Cathedral)> September 14, 2001>>>> The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of> global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or> religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated,> politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.>> In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a> lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed> within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United> States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals> with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who> knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.>> The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in> our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly> elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come> through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some> unseen.>> Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,> and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to> achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition> forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not> only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of> trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South> America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.>> Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist> organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command,> control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will> have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.>> We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a> coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional> campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure> the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial> tools necessary to finish the task.>> The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the> financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of> funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who> support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial> system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,> and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative> financial networks.>> However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the> cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we> seek.>> We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:>> * direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and> international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist> organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of> terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction> (WMD) or their precursors;>> * defending the United States, the American people, and our interests> at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it> reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to> enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate> to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by> acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing> harm against our people and our country; and>> * denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists> by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign> responsibilities.>>> We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international> terrorism. This includes:>> * using the full influence of the United States, and working closely> with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are> illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as> slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government> can condone or support and all must oppose;>> * supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim> world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote> terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;>> * diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by> enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources> on areas most at risk; and>> * using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of> information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of> those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.>>> While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also> strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter> attack.>> This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization> since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council> and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland> Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental> reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland> encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public> and the private sector.>> This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example,> emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with> terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened> to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and> mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop> terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.>> While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism> in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.> Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations> and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where> governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we> will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and> our allies can provide.>> As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work> with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as> non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the> humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to> rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,> threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists>> In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are> ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life.

Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts>>> "We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion.> The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements> look so small.">>>>>> President Bush> Berlin, Germany> May 23, 2002>>>> Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional> disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In> an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our> alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create> horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states> falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to> alleviate suffering and restore stability.>> No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action --> direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic,> and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States> will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:>> * The United States should invest time and resources into building> international relationships and institutions that can help manage local> crises when they emerge.>> * The United States should be realistic about its ability to help> those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when> people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.>>> Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will> apply these principles:>> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of> human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state> of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance> to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace> for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed> to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in> peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a> government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and> counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all> parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and> comprehensive settlement to the conflict.>> The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank> stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic> development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to> establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If> Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront> corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support> for the creation of a Palestinian state.>> Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine.> Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the> United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete> steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.> As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw> fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent> with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement> activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides,> freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians> to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial> role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and> Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.>> In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India> and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested> time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and> Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a> constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With> Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's> choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more> open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to> become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century> and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our> involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in> bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan> that can help defuse military confrontation.>> Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and> respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting> the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to> employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its> neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by> Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.>> In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with> countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil,> Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic> hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity,> opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as> the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States> (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of> the entire hemisphere.>> Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising> from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict> and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and> security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active> strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce> their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of> drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs> in our own country.>> In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist> groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking> activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are> working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat> illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective> sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic> security to the Colombian people.>> In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war,> and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United> States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority --> combating global terror. American interests and American principles,> therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an> African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.> Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's> fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous> borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence> infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.>> An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars> spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions> of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to> confronting these emerging transnational threats.>> Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that> focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This> administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the> region:>> * countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South> Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement> and require focused attention;>> * coordination with European allies and international institutions is> essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace> operations; and>> * Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations> must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational> threats on a sustained basis.>>> Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the> surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are> conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically> waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to> the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a> common responsibility for democratic political systems offers> opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.>> V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends> with Weapons of Mass Destruction>>> "The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and> technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear> weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs,> even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to> strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and> have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the> capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and> we will oppose them with all our power.">>>>>> President Bush> West Point, New York> June 1, 2002>>>> The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our> allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of> force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the> collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security> environment has undergone profound transformation.>> Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our> relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the> balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear> arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as> counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were> inconceivable.>> But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists.> None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power> that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and> motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain> destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest> states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass> destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex> and dangerous.>> In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue> states that, while different in important ways, share a number of> attributes. These states:>> * brutalize their own people and squander their national resources> for the personal gain of the rulers;>> * display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors,> and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;>> * are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with> other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively> to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;>> * sponsor terrorism around the globe; and>> * reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything> for which it stands.>>> At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's> designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against> Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear> weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become> the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested> increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal.> Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as> well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has> become a looming threat to all nations.>> We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients> before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction> against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must> take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new> partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military> forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective> missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence> collection and analysis.>> Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:>> * Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend> against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key> capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce> capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our> homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated> into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of> our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed> adversaries.>> * Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and> terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise> necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy,> arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction> assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when> necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will> continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their> increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and> threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20> billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step> forward.>> * Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD> use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of> WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such> weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading> enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States> must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our> forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.>>> It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of> this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the> United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have> in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy> of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be> caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option.> We cannot let our enemies strike first.>> * In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we> faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an> effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of> retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states> more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and> the wealth of their nations.>> * In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered> weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who> used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons> of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and> military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also> allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our> allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior> of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means> of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.>> * Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a> terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the> targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death> and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between> states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to> action.>>> For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer> an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves> against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars> and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption> on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible> mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.>> We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and> objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not> seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would> fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use> of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed> and delivered covertly and without warning.>> The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian> population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law> of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001,> mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and> these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired> and used weapons of mass destruction.>> The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions> to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the> threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling> the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if> uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To> forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United> States will, if necessary, act preemptively.>> The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging> threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression.> Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek> the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot> remain idle while dangers gather.>> We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our> actions. To support preemptive options, we will:>> * build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide> timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;>> * coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the> most dangerous threats; and>> * continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to> conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.>>> The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat> to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our> actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.>> VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and> Free Trade.>>> "When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a> privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever> enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in> better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade> revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.">>>>>> President Bush> Monterrey, Mexico> March 22, 2002>>>> A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing> prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth> supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher> incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs> economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it> reinforces the habits of liberty.>> We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's> shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic> policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our> economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of> policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic> growth, including:>> * pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business> investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;>> * tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that> improve incentives for work and investment;>> * rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are> confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic> endeavors;>> * strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most> efficient use;>> * sound fiscal policies to support business activity;>> * investments in health and education that improve the well-being and> skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and>> * free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the> diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and> opportunity.>>> The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not> command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the> best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further> strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for> all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the> developing world.>> A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S.> national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies> for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake> of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in> their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are> Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of> non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to> use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners --> including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they> are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher> global economic growth.>> Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic> growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand> the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging> markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise> living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a> world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that> allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in> their future.>> We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve> access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will> continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial> markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International> Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action> Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and> more effectively resolving them when they occur.>> The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from> occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing> so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy> conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on> achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy,> exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.>> The concept of "free trade" arose as a moral principle even before it> became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others> value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something> that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the> freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free> trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:>> * Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we> helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda,> especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for> completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the> accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade> Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.>> * Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies> in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of> the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United> States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners,> targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and> government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the> poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences> allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free> trade.>> * Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the> free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration> will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and> Singapore.

The United States is implementing The Africa> Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods> produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing> disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a> global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations> that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture.

Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the> change and dynamism of open markets.>> * Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster> economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with> widening prosperity.

Where governments have> implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels> of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should> set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's> poorest economies within a decade.>> The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to> achieve this goal:>> * Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of> national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core> development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our> present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone,> these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge> Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest> in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight> corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest> in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and> enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward> countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those> that have not to implement reforms.>> * Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development> banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a> comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other> multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of> the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S.> contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S.> contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the> World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African> Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing> poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially> in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral> development banks to focus on activities that increase economic> productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,> and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant> must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in> developing countries.>> * Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development> assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's> poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that> more children are getting a better education, more people have access to> health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a> better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure> the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering> results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own> development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral> development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for> achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA> replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation> system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time,> donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the> achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S.> contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the> World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this> progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything> that these institutions do.>> * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in> the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants> is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,> particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with> ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA> agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the> poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water,> sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress> by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development> banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private> sector to match government efforts by using grants to support> development projects that show results.>> * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are> the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,> most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and> foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows> as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national> security strategy.>> * Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor> countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics> like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be> threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the> developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest> governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective> local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new> global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan> and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for> treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than> twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the> global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.>> * Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of> democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources> are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States> will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20> percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher> training in Africa.

[ILUG] PPPD disconnects on me!Hello folks!I'm new to Linux, so here goes...I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driverfor it.Minicom is very much able to dial out.But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial infoof my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some scriptsomewhere).It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connectionis established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serialport using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, mefriend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired ofhaving to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back toLinux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never haveto go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).Thanks a million.Carlos-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	0

To pick an obvious example., if you want to do linear    R> algebra, then Java isn't a serious candidate at all.If you want to do http, C gets pretty muddy (curl is about the bestchoice I've found) but I grant you that: No language is the be-all andend-all.I envy some of those posting to this list.  I've been in business for24 years and I haven't yet had the luxury of writing every line ofcode for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time tomaximize the amount of work done elsewhere.  As much as I hate dealing with someone else's blackbox, as much asI've spent sleepless nights second-guessing external libs, I've neverever had the luxury to do otherwise. It must be wonderful to beresponsible for something you are actually responsible for, and I amso sick of being blamed for other people's design mistakes.Maybe there's an archive somewhere I need to know about, but I've beenusing C since DrDobbs first published SmallC and yet I've never foundany decent LGPL libs cataloged in such a way that I can just type inthe task and get back an API.  Because of Javadoc, which is by nomeans perfect, Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-partylibs, second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also reallyhate with a passion, yet end up using the most for exactly this reason.For example, take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to rolltogether a telnet client with a tokenizer, perl-regex preprocessing astream to produce parseable XML, project that XML into relationaldatabases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema, and open anXMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.  Wherecan I find C libs for those components?  On the webserver, we then needed a multithreaded read-only http socketwhich can spawn persistent data-caching servlets that periodicallyrefresh themselves over socket connections to the relational database,presenting the retreived values through XSLT-defined transforms, andagain, where can I find such stuff for C ... or for any other langaugebut Java?  Wombat (servlet spec for Perl) was inviting, but it's notready for prime-time, and re-inventing that entire shopping list in Cis just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of 8 weeks.When you need C libs, or even C++ libs, where's the best place to shop?Where do you find standards-based portable RDBMS API? (ODBC?) How doyou evaluate these things without actually fetching every one andtrying it out?In a perfect universe, I'd use Ocaml or even Ruby, but I don't see thesocial infrastructure for either happening during my professionallifetime.
