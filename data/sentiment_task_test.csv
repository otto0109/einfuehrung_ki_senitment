flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .	0
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .	0
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .	0
i was a little disappointed in the low end .	0
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3 .	1
loading cds was somewhat time-consuming  but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .	0
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )	0
it has several play options  one of the best is an option to shuffle  based on all or a certain playlist .	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .	1
transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .	0
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .	0
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .	1
and so far  i 've been very pleased .	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie .	1
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .	0
although the sound-quality is good  it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .	0
some dvd 's i rented would not play .	0
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .	1
i chose this one because from what i read  it was the best deal for the money .	1
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .	1
the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .	0
6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .	0
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .	0
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts  and both were bad .	0
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .	1
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .	1
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .	0
4 .the zen * stores * data files  but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .	0
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7 !	0
for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .	1
so sit back  relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can  and for a fraction of the price !	1
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out )  the g3 has much sharper white offsets .	1
mediasource did not recognize my tags !	0
this camera has a major design flaw .	0
yes  i recommend it over the competition .	1
as an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .	0
it could be a little bit bigger  but it 's easy to get used to .	0
the lcd screen was very large and readable .	1
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .	1
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .	1
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily  and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing .	0
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .	1
( he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them . )	1
for the price  it 's a very nice dvd player .	1
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems .	0
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .	0
fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .	0
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .	0
after @ 3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .	0
output through component connections looks very good  on my non-hd tv .	1
the interface software itself  which should be user-friendly  was anything but easy-to-use .	0
it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .	1
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate  something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel	0
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window  but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .	1
navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .	0
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .	0
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets  navigating options  playlists  etc ) .	1
unfortunately  the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .	0
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .	1
the light auto-correction is awesome .	1
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .	1
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .	1
another plus in my book  no file limits !	1
it 's worth it .	1
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it  since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !	0
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .	0
when the player was working it was great but .	0
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .	0
the included memory card is too small .	0
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .	1
i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .	0
one beef is the scroll  it does n't work as well as i 'd like .	0
at double-speed ( 2x forward speed )  it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth  but twice as fast !	1
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .	1
the dvd player just would't recognize them .	0
i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .	1
just bought one  i 've enjoyed it to date .	1
there was neither picture nor sound .	0
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .	0
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )	1
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .	1
* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .	0
getting files onto it is quick and painless .	1
second  the menu system and controls are poorly designed .	0
the software failed repeatedly .	0
i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .	0
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while  prompting a reset .	0
i love this player .	1
