flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost.
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust.
about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder.
i was a little disappointed in the low end.
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared.
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g3.
loading cds was somewhat time-consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well.
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation.
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn, so you cannot get an accurate adjustment (for those of you who do not know what a diopter adjustment is it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight. )
it has several play options one of the best is an option to shuffle based on all or a certain playlist.
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again.
transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0.
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused.
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing.
and so far I have been very pleased.
then sorting the files is easy as pie.
I have sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting a ra with no response.
although the sound-quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 players to result in a good product.
some dvd's i rented would not play.
they player's interface itself is also very easy to use.
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money.
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have taken simply by using the auto mode.
the catch is that while it plays movies just fine it has refused to read second discs with the movie" extras" on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that.
6) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed.
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection.
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad.
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch.
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable.
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player.
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best.
they have a bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name (and they are long) .
4 .the zen * stores * data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk (they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched) .
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd's transferred.
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images (i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 byte cf with a 512 byte cf which gives me 130 raw images as opposed to 7 !
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised.
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that cannot do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price !
8. perhaps inspired by the canon's factory white-correction settings (which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc. could be cleaned out) the g3 has much sharper white offsets.
mediasource did not recognize my tags !
this camera has a major design flaw.
yes i recommend it over the competition.
as an engineer i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale.
it could be a little bigger but it is easy to get used to.
the lcd screen was very large and readable.
I am giving this player cautious recommendation.
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else I have seen.
a) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definitely would not survive a drop
I have had this player for several months, and it reads most discs but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players (from friends season 2) .
what the hell is wrong with this thing.
most of them are already switched to apex, and they are happy.
(he had owned two apex dvd players and was pleased with both of them. )
for the price it is a very nice dvd player.
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
the player itself has all sorts of problems.
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain.
fortunately the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me, i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4.
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them.
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software.
after @ 3 months it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds.
output through component connections looks very good on my months tv.
the interface software itself which should be user-friendly was anything but easy-to-use.
it does not smell like burning plastic when you open the drive.
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the baseplate something that you would not see on a sony and an overall plastic feel
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures.
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection.
navigation system - the zen extra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs.
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed.
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well (sound presets navigating options playlists etc.) .
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way.
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors.
the light autocorrection is awesome.
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition, although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry.
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality.
another plus in my book no file limits !
it is worth it.
in general, it is easy to use and well laid out.
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $40 for the 2 year" no questions asked" replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
we have purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work" apex" dvd players and none worked.
when the player was working it was great but.
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual.
the included memory card is too small.
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you are listening to.
i tried e-mailing apex, and they come back saying undeliverable.
one beef is the scroll it does not work as well as I would like.
at double-speed (2x forward speed) it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth but twice as fast !
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect.
the dvd player just would not recognize them.
i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer.
just bought one I have enjoyed it to date.
there was neither picture nor sound.
the customer service dept did not list a toll-free number, and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line.
it plays just about any format (check before you buy if it plays yours. )
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbies who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well.
* eax equalizer accentuates finished quality of mp3 files.
getting files onto it is quick and painless.
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed.
the software failed repeatedly.
i also did not like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode.
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented.
the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while prompting a reset.
i love this player.
